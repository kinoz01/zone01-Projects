## Environment Variables

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    // Variable to hold the content
    var myVar string

    // Check for a specific environment variable (e.g., "GO_TEST_MODE")
    if os.Getenv("GO_TEST_MODE") != "" {
        // In test mode
        myVar = "This is test content"
    } else {
        // In regular execution
        myVar = "This is regular execution content"
    }

    fmt.Println(myVar)
}
```

### How it Works

- **Environment Variable**: We'll create a custom environment variable called `GO_TEST_MODE`.  The value of the environment variable doesn't really matter; what's important is that it exists only when you're running tests.

- `os.Getenv`: The os package provides the `Getenv` function.  It tries to fetch the value of an environment variable by its name. If the variable isn't set, it returns an empty string.

- **Conditional Logic**:  We use an if statement to check if `GO_TEST_MODE` has a value (meaning it's set). If it does, we know we're running tests, so we assign the test-specific content to `myVar`. Otherwise, we assign the content for regular execution.

**Test Execution**: Before running your tests, set the environment variable. Here's how to do it for the different test tools:

- Go Test (built-in):
```Bash
GO_TEST_MODE=true go test
```

- Popular testing frameworks (e.g., `Testify`): Often, these allow you to set environment variables in their config files or through command-line flags. Refer to the framework's documentation for details.
