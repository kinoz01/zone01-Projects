## `uintptr` and Pointers Arithmetic 

`address1 := uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&x))`

- **Result Type**: The variable address will have the type `uintptr`, which is an unsigned integer large enough to store a memory address.
- **Purpose**: This is often used when you need to perform pointer arithmetic (adding or subtracting offsets from the address) or pass the address to a function that expects a `uintptr` (e.g., some low-level system calls).

- **Benefits**:
    1. Pointer arithmetic is allowed on `uintptr` values.
    2. Can be used for interactions with external code (e.g., C libraries) that require raw memory addresses.
- **Drawbacks**:
    1. Loses type information about the data pointed to.
    2. Doesn't prevent the garbage collector from moving or reclaiming the memory pointed to.
    3. Requires extra care to ensure you're not accidentally accessing memory you shouldn't be.


`address2 := unsafe.Pointer(&x)`

- **Result Type**: The variable address will have the type `unsafe.Pointer`, which is a generic pointer capable of holding the address of any value.
- **Purpose**: This is often used when you need to pass the address of a variable to a function that expects an `unsafe.Pointer`. It's also used in type punning scenarios where you intentionally reinterpret the data at that memory location as a different type.

- **Benefits**:
    1. Maintains some connection to the original pointer type (even though it's untyped).
    2. Can be used in situations where you need to manipulate data at the byte level.
- **Drawbacks**:
    1. Requires explicit conversion to a typed pointer before dereferencing to access the value.
    2. Can lead to type safety issues if not used carefully.

> **Note**  
In Go, you need both `unsafe.Pointer` and `uintptr` for pointer arithmetic because Go does not allow arithmetic directly on pointers (`unsafe.Pointer`).



### Example 1

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

type MyStruct struct {
	a int
	b byte
}

func main() {
	x := MyStruct{a: 10, b: 'A'}

	// uintptr
	address1 := uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&x))
	address1 += unsafe.Offsetof(x.b) // Pointer arithmetic
	bValue := *(*byte)(unsafe.Pointer(address1))

	// unsafe.Pointer
	address2 := unsafe.Pointer(&x)
	pb := (*byte)(unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(address2) + unsafe.Offsetof(x.b))) // other way doing pointer arithmetic
	bValue2 := *pb

	fmt.Println(bValue, bValue2) // Output: 65 65 ('A' in ASCII)
	fmt.Println(string(bValue), string(bValue2))
}
```


### Example 2

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

type MyStruct struct {
	data [10]int
}

func main() {
	s := MyStruct{data: [10]int{11, 1, 11, 9, 3, 12, 8, 7, 5, 10}}

	ptr1 := &s.data[0]
	// Get the memory address of s
	ptr := unsafe.Pointer(&s) // by default we get the address of the first element same as doing:
	ptr = unsafe.Pointer(&s.data[0])

	fmt.Println("raw address value:", ptr)
	fmt.Println("address value of &s is the same we just convert it to unsafe without changing the address:", ptr1)
	// Convert to uintptr to do pointer arithmetic
	address := uintptr(ptr)
	fmt.Println("Address of s after conversion:", address)

	// Calculate the size of an int in bytes
	intSize := unsafe.Sizeof(s.data[0])
	fmt.Println("the size of an int:", intSize)

	// Calculate address of 5th element in the data array
	fifthElementAddr := uintptr(ptr) + 5*intSize
	fmt.Println("Address of 5th element:", fifthElementAddr)

	// Convert back to pointer and access the element (with caution!)
	fifthElementPtr := (*int)(unsafe.Pointer(fifthElementAddr))
	fmt.Println("5th element:", *fifthElementPtr)
}
```

### Important Distinction

```go
address1 := uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&x))
address2 := unsafe.Pointer(&x)
```

Both `address1` and `address2` are variables that have been assigned values that represent the memory address of the variable `x`.

- `address1` stores this memory address as an unsigned integer (`uintptr`), allowing you to perform calculations with it.
- `address2` stores this memory address as an `unsafe.Pointer`, which is a generic pointer type that can point to any data type.


> While both variables "point to" the same memory location, the way they store that address is different due to their types:

- `uintptr` is just a number representing the address.
- `unsafe.Pointer` is a pointer type, giving you the ability to interact with the data at that address (though with caution, as it involves bypassing some type safety mechanisms).

### Example 3 

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "unsafe"
)

func main() {
    var x int = 42

    // Using uintptr
    var addr uintptr = uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&x))
    fmt.Printf("Address of x using uintptr printed in hexadecimal: %x\n", addr)
	fmt.Printf("Address of x using uintptr: %v\n", addr)

	address2 := addr +1 
	fmt.Println("address of addr shifted by 1:", address2)

    // Using unsafe.Pointer
    var ptr unsafe.Pointer = unsafe.Pointer(&x)
    fmt.Printf("Address of x using unsafe.Pointer: %p\n", ptr)

    // Dereferencing unsafe.Pointer (requires casting)
    var y *int = (*int)(ptr)
    fmt.Printf("Value of x through unsafe.Pointer: %d\n", *y)

	addrValue := *(*int)(unsafe.Pointer(addr))
	fmt.Println("Get value from unintptr address:", addrValue)
}
```

- `uintptr`: In the example, `addr` holds the memory address of `x` as an integer value. You can print it, perform arithmetic on it, but you cannot dereference it directly.
- `unsafe.Pointer`: `ptr` holds the same memory address but as a pointer type. You can cast `unsafe.Pointer` to a specific pointer type (like `*int`) and then dereference it to access or modify the value at that address.

> To access the value stored at the `uintptr` address, you need to convert `uintptr` back to `unsafe.Pointer`. You then can cast `unsafe.Pointer` and dereference it:

```go
addrValue := *(*int)unsafe.Pointer(addr)
fmt.Println(addrValue)
```

> `unsafe.Pointer` is what allow us to do pointer arithmetics because if we just put :

```go
address :=  uintptr(&table)
```

we will get an error we have to put :
```go
address :=  uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&table))
```
