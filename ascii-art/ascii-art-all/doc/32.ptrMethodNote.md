Go automatically dereferences pointers within methods:

```go
package main

import "fmt"

type person struct {
    name string
    age  int
}

func (p *person) birthday() {
    // No need for (*p).age; Go does this for you
    p.age++ 
}

func main() {
    john := person{name: "John", age: 30}

    // No need to Call the birthday method on a pointer to john
    (&john).birthday()  

    //You can just put:
    john.birthday()

    fmt.Printf("John is now %d years old\n", john.age) 
}
```

Go knows that `p` is a pointer and automatically dereferences it, allowing us to directly modify the `age` field of the original `john` struct.  
The output will be "John is now 31 years old." This confirms that the original `john` struct was modified
