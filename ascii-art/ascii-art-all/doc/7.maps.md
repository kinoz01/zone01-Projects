## Maps

> We can describe a map in Go as a collection of data similar to a slice, but instead of using numerical indices to access elements, we use keys.

Imagine you have a collection of items, but instead of numbered slots (like in a slice), you have labeled boxes. Each box has a unique label (the key) that you use to find the item inside (the value).

This is essentially how maps work in Go. The labels are your keys, and the items are your values.  Instead of saying for example "Give me the item at index 2," you say, "Give me the item labeled 'Bob'."


**Why Use Maps?**

- **Fast Lookups**: Maps are incredibly efficient for finding values based on their keys. It's like having a direct line to the correct box, no matter how many boxes you have.
- **Flexible Keys**: You can use almost any data type as a key (strings, numbers, etc.), making them versatile for various tasks.
- **Associative Data**: Maps are perfect for representing relationships between pieces of information (e.g., names and ages, product IDs and prices).

**Note**

If you try to retrieve the value for a key which does not exist in the map, it will return the zero value of the value type. This can confuse you, especially if the default value of your `ElementType` (for example, 0 for an `int`), is a valid value. To check whether a key exists in your map, you can use: 

```go
value, exists := foo["baz"]
// If the key "baz" does not exist in the map[string]int Map,
// value: 0; exists: false
```


### map random order

> In Go, maps are not ordered, meaning the iteration order over map keys is random. Each time you iterate over a map, the keys may appear in a different order. Here's a simple Go program to demonstrate this behavior:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func main() {
	// Create a map with some key-value pairs
	myMap := map[string]int{
		"apple":  1,
		"banana": 2,
		"cherry": 3,
		"date":   4,
		"fig":    5,
	}

	// Print the map multiple times to show the random order
	printMap(myMap)
	fmt.Println()
}

func printMap(m map[string]int) {
	for k, v := range m {
		fmt.Printf("%s: %d\n", k, v)
	}
}
```
Running this program multiple times will show that the order in which the keys appear can change each time.
