```go
_, _, err := syscall.Syscall(syscall.SYS_IOCTL, uintptr(2), syscall.TIOCGWINSZ, uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&dimensions)))
```

Let's pinpoint the locations in the Linux kernel source code where the system call dispatch process occurs. Keep in mind that the exact file paths might vary slightly depending on your kernel version.

We will just try to trace our syscall (some of this might be wrong but we are here just to take a basic idea of what's going on)

1. **Triggering the Interrupt/Trap**

- **Go Runtime**: The Go runtime code responsible for executing system calls resides in the `src/runtime/sys_linux_amd64.s` file (or similar for other architectures).
- **Assembly Instruction**: Look for the `SYSCALL` or `INT $0x80` instructions. These are the assembly instructions that trigger the software interrupt to enter kernel mode.

2. **System Call Table**

- **Kernel Source**: The system call table is defined in the `arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl` file (for 64-bit systems) or `arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_32.tbl` (for 32-bit systems).
- **Structure**: This file essentially maps system call numbers to their corresponding function names in the kernel.

3. **`sys_ioctl` Function**

It is found in:

```bash
tools/include/nolibc/sys.h
```

```c
int sys_ioctl(int fd, unsigned long req, void *value)
{
	return my_syscall3(__NR_ioctl, fd, req, value);
}

static __attribute__((unused))
int ioctl(int fd, unsigned long req, void *value)
{
	return __sysret(sys_ioctl(fd, req, value));
}
```
> `__sysret` and `my_syscall3` are custom implementation of making a system call in assembly using inline assembly in `C`. 

4. `ioctl` and `TIOCGWINSZ`

Next the place where I can find a relation between these two is here:

```bash
tools/lib/subcmd/help.c
```

or
```bash
tools/perf/util/term.c
```

```c
static void get_term_dimensions(struct winsize *ws)
{
	char *s = getenv("LINES");

	if (s != NULL) {
		ws->ws_row = atoi(s);
		s = getenv("COLUMNS");
		if (s != NULL) {
			ws->ws_col = atoi(s);
			if (ws->ws_row && ws->ws_col)
				return;
		}
	}
#ifdef TIOCGWINSZ
	if (ioctl(1, TIOCGWINSZ, ws) == 0 &&
	    ws->ws_row && ws->ws_col)
		return;
#endif
	ws->ws_row = 25;
	ws->ws_col = 80;
}
```

next we have:

```c
static int tiocgwinsz(struct tty_struct *tty, struct winsize __user *arg)
{
	int err;

	mutex_lock(&tty->winsize_mutex);
	err = copy_to_user(arg, &tty->winsize, sizeof(*arg));
	mutex_unlock(&tty->winsize_mutex);

	return err ? -EFAULT : 0;
}
```

where :

- `tiocgwinsz`: This is the name of the function that handles the `TIOCGWINSZ` `ioctl` command. It takes two arguments:
    - tt`y: A pointer to the `tty_struct` structure, which represents the terminal device in the kernel.
    - `arg`: A pointer to a user-space `winsize` structure where the terminal window size information will be copied.

- `mutex_lock(&tty->winsize_mutex)`: This line acquires a `mutex` (mutual exclusion lock) to protect the `winsize` data within the `tty_struct` structure. This ensures that the window size information is not modified concurrently by another process while it's being read.

- `err = copy_to_user(arg, &tty->winsize, sizeof(*arg))`: This is the key line. It copies the `winsize` structure (`tty->winsize`) from kernel space into the user-space buffer pointed to by arg. The `copy_to_user` function is a safe way to copy data from kernel space to user space, as it handles potential issues like invalid user-space addresses.

- `mutex_unlock(&tty->winsize_mutex)`: This line releases the mutex, allowing other processes to access the `winsize` data again.

- `return err ? -EFAULT : 0;`: This line returns the result of the operation.
    - If `copy_to_user` succeeded (returned 0), the function returns 0 to indicate success.
    - If `copy_to_user` failed (returned a non-zero value), the function returns -EFAULT, which is a standard error code indicating a fault in copying to user space.


This was just a basic overview of what's happening, you can get back to this topic later.
