## uintptr

1. What is `uintptr`?

- **Type**: It's an unsigned integer type (only positive values) designed to hold memory addresses.
- **Size**: Its size is platform-dependent, meaning it's either 32 bits on 32-bit systems or 64 bits on 64-bit systems. This ensures it can accommodate the full range of memory addresses your system can support.
- **Purpose**: Primarily used for low-level programming, interacting with `C` code, and performing pointer arithmetic.

2. Why Do We Need `uintptr`?

- **Pointer Arithmetic**: Unlike regular `int` types, you can safely perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction) on `uintptr` values. This is crucial when you need to navigate through memory or calculate offsets within data structures.

- **C Interoperability**: When working with `C` libraries or system calls, you often need to deal with raw memory addresses. `uintptr` provides a bridge between Go's type-safe world and the less-restricted environment of `C`.

- **Special Cases**: Some Go functions in the unsafe package (designed for low-level operations) take `uintptr` as arguments, allowing you to perform actions that would be impossible with regular int types.
