## `t.Parallel`

> `T.Parallel` is a method provided by Go's testing package that allows test functions (including sub-tests) to run in parallel. This can significantly speed up the test execution, especially when the tests are independent and do not interfere with each other.

To run tests in parallel in Go, you can use the `t.Parallel()` method. This method allows each test to be run in its own goroutine, making it possible to run multiple tests simultaneously. This can speed up the test suite significantly, especially if the tests are independent of each other.

> **Usage**: Call `t.Parallel` within a test function or sub-test to indicate that it can run in parallel with other parallel tests.

You can call `t.Parallel()` in two places within your Go tests:

1. **Top-Level Test Functions**: You can call `t.Parallel()` directly within the main test function itself. This tells the testing framework that all of the subtests within that main test can potentially run in parallel.

2. **Subtest Functions**: You can also call `t.Parallel()` inside the functions you pass to `t.Run`. This indicates that the specific subtest can run concurrently with other subtests that are also marked as parallel.

### How It Works

- **Marking for Parallelism**: When you call `t.Parallel()` within a test or subtest, you're essentially marking it as eligible for parallel execution. The testing framework doesn't immediately run it in a separate goroutine.
- **Scheduler's Decision**: The Go runtime's scheduler makes the final decision on whether to actually execute tests in parallel. It takes into account factors like the number of CPU cores, the presence of blocking operations, and the overall system load.
- **Potential for Concurrent Execution**: If the conditions are favorable, the scheduler will create separate goroutines for the parallel tests and execute them concurrently.

### Important Considerations:

- **Shared State**: Be cautious when using `t.Parallel() `if your tests share state. Use synchronization mechanisms (e.g., `mutexes`) to prevent race conditions.
- **Test Ordering**: Avoid assuming a specific order of execution for parallel tests or subtests.
- **Blocking Operations**: If a parallel test contains blocking operations (network requests, file I/O, etc.), it might not actually be run concurrently, as the scheduler tries to optimize for performance.

> **Race Conditions**: If your subtests access and modify shared data, be extremely careful about race conditions when using `t.Parallel()`. Use synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, channels) to ensure safe concurrent access.

> if you call `t.Parallel()` within the main test function, it will mark the entire test and all its subtests to run in parallel. In this case, you don't need to explicitly call `t.Parallel()` within each subtest.

### `Parallel` with `Mutex` Synchronization

> A mutex (short for "mutual exclusion") is a synchronization primitive in Go's `sync` package that helps you avoid race conditions. It acts as a lock that ensures only one goroutine can access a shared resource at a time.

We'll use a `sync.Mutex` to serialize access to `os.Stdout` and ensure that no two tests manipulate `os.Stdout` at the same time.

#### How to Use a `Mutex` with Parallel Tests

1. Declare the Mutex as a global variable:

- Create a `sync.Mutex` variable at a scope that's accessible to all the subtests that need to access the shared data.

```go 
var mu sync.Mutex
```

2. Lock and unlock the Mutex Before and after Access:

```go
mu.Lock()
defer mu.Unlock()
```

### More Explanation

#### Mutex: The Gatekeeper of Shared Resources

Imagine a mutex as a special kind of lock that guards a shared resource (a variable, data structure, etc.) in your program. Here's the breakdown of its core functions:

1. **Mutual Exclusion**: The primary role of a mutex is to ensure that only one goroutine (or thread in other languages) can access the protected resource at any given time. This is where the name "mutual exclusion" comes from.  It prevents multiple goroutines from reading or writing the same data simultaneously, which is crucial to avoid race conditions.

2. Locking and Unlocking:
    - `Lock()`: When a goroutine wants to access the shared resource, it calls the `Lock()` method on the mutex.
        - If the mutex is unlocked, the goroutine acquires the lock and proceeds to work with the resource.
        - If the mutex is already locked by another goroutine, the current goroutine is blocked (paused) and put into a waiting queue until the lock becomes available.
    - `Unlock()`: After the goroutine has finished working with the resource, it calls `Unlock()` to release the lock. This allows the next waiting goroutine (if any) to acquire the lock and access the resource.

3. Fairness (Usually):  Most mutex implementations try to be fair, meaning they try to give goroutines a chance to acquire the lock in the order they requested it. However, absolute fairness is not always guaranteed, especially under heavy contention.

**Analogy**

Think of a mutex like a single-occupancy restroom:

- Locked: When someone is inside the restroom, the door is locked, and no one else can enter.
- Waiting: If someone arrives while the restroom is occupied, they wait in a line outside the door.
- Unlocked: When the person inside finishes, they unlock the door, and the next person in line can enter.

**Key Points**

- **Not for Communication**: `Mutexes` are not designed for direct communication between goroutines. They simply control access to shared data. If you need to communicate, use channels or other mechanisms.
- **Overhead**: Using a mutex introduces a small amount of overhead due to the locking and unlocking operations. In most cases, this overhead is negligible compared to the potential problems caused by race conditions.
- **Deadlocks**: If not used carefully, `mutexes` can lead to deadlocks, where goroutines are stuck waiting for each other to release locks. Avoid circular dependencies and always unlock `mutexes` promptly.

#### Choose the Right Synchronization Primitive

Depending on your specific requirements, other synchronization tools (e.g., channels, `sync.WaitGroup`, atomic operations) might be more suitable than a mutex.
