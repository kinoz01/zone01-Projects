## `Syscall`

The `Syscall` function in Go is part of the `syscall`package and is used to execute system calls directly from Go code. *System calls are requests made by a program to the operating system kernel*, typically to perform tasks such as interacting with hardware, managing processes, or accessing system resources. The `Syscall6` function specifically is designed to handle system calls that require six arguments.

```go
func Syscall(trap, a1, a2, a3, a4 uintptr) (r1, r2 uintptr, err Errno)
```

The first parameter `trap` represents the system call number, while `a1` through `a3` represent the arguments required for the system call.

### Example

```go
_, _, err := syscall.Syscall(syscall.SYS_IOCTL, uintptr(2), syscall.TIOCGWINSZ, uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&dimensions)))
```

- `syscall.SYS_IOCTL`: The *system call number* for performing I/O control operations.

- `uintptr(2)`: The **file descriptor** for the terminal. In Unix-like systems, file descriptor 0 represents standard input, 1 represents standard output, and 2 represents standard error. You can replace numbers by:  
`syscall.Stdin`, `syscall.Stdout` or `syscall.Stderr`.

- `syscall.TIOCGWINSZ`: A *request code* indicating that we want to get the terminal window size.

- `uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&dimensions))`: A pointer to the `dimensions` array. The system call will write the terminal dimensions into this array.


### Why the system call number is called `trap`?

- **Traps**: In a general sense, a trap is a synchronous exception that transfers control from a user-level process to the operating system kernel. This can happen due to various reasons, such as:

    - **System calls**: A deliberate request from the user process to access privileged kernel functions. A system call is a specific type of trap. It's a mechanism for a user process to request services from the kernel that it cannot perform itself (like file operations, network communication, or process management).
    - **Hardware exceptions**: Errors like division by zero, invalid memory access, or attempting to execute privileged instructions.
    - **Software interrupts**: Interrupts triggered by specific instructions in the code.

#### Linux System Calls: The Low-Level Interface

In Linux, system calls are the fundamental way for a user-space program (like your Go application) to request services from the kernel. They cover everything from basic file operations to network communication and process management.

Here's how system calls typically work on Linux:

1. **Trap Instruction**: Your Go code calls the `Syscall` function (or a similar wrapper). This function eventually executes a special trap instruction (e.g., `int 0x80` on older systems or `syscall` on newer ones).

2. **Mode Switch**: The trap instruction causes a transition from user mode (where your Go code runs) to kernel mode.  This is a privileged mode where the kernel has full access to the system's hardware and resources.

3. **System Call Number**:  The trap instruction also includes a system call number. This is a numerical code that identifies the specific service you're requesting from the kernel (e.g., read from a file, create a new process).

4. **Kernel Handling**: The kernel looks up the system call number in a table and jumps to the corresponding kernel function. This function performs the requested operation and returns a result (and possibly an error code).

5. **Return to User Mode**: The kernel switches back to user mode, and the result of the system call is made available to your Go code.
