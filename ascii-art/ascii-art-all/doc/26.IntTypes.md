## Signed Integer Types

In Go, several integer types are available, each with different bit lengths and purposes. Let's detail each type, including both signed (`int`) and unsigned (`uint`) integers, and explain their memory consumption.

### 1. `int`

- Description: The default integer type. Its size depends on the platform (32-bit or 64-bit).
- Memory:

    - On 32-bit systems: 4 bytes (32 bits)
    - On 64-bit systems: 8 bytes (64 bits)

### 2. `int8`

- Description: A signed 8-bit integer.
- Range: -128 to 127
- Memory: 1 byte (8 bits)

### 3. `int16`

- Description: A signed 16-bit integer.
- Range: -32,768 to 32,767
- Memory: 2 bytes (16 bits)

### 4. `int32`

- Description: A signed 32-bit integer.
- Range: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
- Memory: 4 bytes (32 bits)

### 5. `int64`

- Description: A signed 64-bit integer.
- Range: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
- Memory: 8 bytes (64 bits)

## Unsigned Integer Types

1. `uint`

- Description: The default unsigned integer type. Its size depends on the platform (32-bit or 64-bit).
- Memory:

    - On 32-bit systems: 4 bytes (32 bits)
    - On 64-bit systems: 8 bytes (64 bits)

2. `uint8`

- Description: An unsigned 8-bit integer.
- Range: 0 to 255
- Memory: 1 byte (8 bits)

3. `uint16`

- Description: An unsigned 16-bit integer.
- Range: 0 to 65,535
- Memory: 2 bytes (16 bits)

4. `uint32`

- Description: An unsigned 32-bit integer.
- Range: 0 to 4,294,967,295
- Memory: 4 bytes (32 bits)

5. `uint64`

- Description: An unsigned 64-bit integer.
- Range: 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615
- Memory: 8 bytes (64 bits)

## Sspecial Integer Types

- `uintptr`:
    - Description: An unsigned integer large enough to store the uninterpreted bits of a pointer value.
    - Memory: Depends on the platform (usually 4 bytes on 32-bit systems and 8 bytes on 64-bit systems)


```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "unsafe"
)

func main() {
    var a int8 = 5    
    var b uint8 = 127 
    var c int16 = -1024 
    var d uint16 = 65535 
    var e int32 = 2147483647 
    var f uint32 = 4294967295
    var g int64 = -9223372036854775808 
    var h uint64 = 18446744073709551615

    // Print sizes in bytes
    fmt.Println("Size of int8:", unsafe.Sizeof(a), "bytes") 
    fmt.Println("Size of uint8:", unsafe.Sizeof(b), "bytes")
    fmt.Println("Size of int16:", unsafe.Sizeof(c), "bytes")
    fmt.Println("Size of uint16:", unsafe.Sizeof(d), "bytes")
    fmt.Println("Size of int32:", unsafe.Sizeof(e), "bytes")
    fmt.Println("Size of uint32:", unsafe.Sizeof(f), "bytes")
    fmt.Println("Size of int64:", unsafe.Sizeof(g), "bytes")
    fmt.Println("Size of uint64:", unsafe.Sizeof(h), "bytes")

    // Binary representations (assuming little-endian)
    fmt.Printf("Binary of int8: %08b\n", a)  
    fmt.Printf("Binary of uint8: %08b\n", b)
    fmt.Printf("Binary of int16: %016b\n", c) 
    fmt.Printf("Binary of uint16: %016b\n", d)
    fmt.Printf("Binary of int32: %032b\n", e) 
    fmt.Printf("Binary of uint32: %032b\n", f)
    fmt.Printf("Binary of int64: %064b\n", g)
    fmt.Printf("Binary of uint64: %064b\n", h)
}
```
