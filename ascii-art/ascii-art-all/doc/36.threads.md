## Definition

A **thread** is the smallest unit of a process that can be scheduled and executed by the operating system. Each thread represents a separate path of execution within a program. Multiple threads within the same process share the same data space, which allows them to communicate with each other more easily than separate processes.

## More Explanation

> A thread is like a lightweight subprocess within a process. A process can create multiple threads to run concurrently, sharing the same memory space and resources.

Think of a process as a factory and threads as workers within the factory. Each worker can perform different tasks simultaneously, sharing tools and materials within the factory.

Here's why processes create multiple threads:

- **Concurrency**: Threads allow a process to divide its work into smaller tasks that can be executed concurrently, improving performance and responsiveness.
- **Efficiency**: Threads share memory and resources, which makes them more efficient to create and manage than separate processes.
- **Communication**: Threads within the same process can easily communicate and synchronize their actions, which is essential for many types of applications.

However, it's important to note that not all processes need to create multiple threads. Some processes can perform their tasks sequentially with just a single thread. Whether or not to use multiple threads depends on the nature of the task and the desired performance characteristics.

## Key Points

1. **Concurrency**: Threads allow for multiple sequences of instructions to run concurrently within the same program, enabling efficient utilization of CPU resources.
2. **Parallelism**: On multi-core processors, threads can run in parallel, improving the performance of applications.
3. **Shared Resources**: Threads within the same process share memory and other resources, which facilitates inter-thread communication but also requires careful synchronization to avoid conflicts.
4. **Lightweight**: Creating and managing threads is generally less resource-intensive compared to processes because threads share the processâ€™s resources.

> **Concurrency** refers to the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks at the same time. It doesn't necessarily mean that these tasks are executed simultaneously (parallelism), but rather that progress can be made on more than one task during the same period of time. Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once, whereas parallelism is about doing lots of things at the same time.

## Usage:

- **Multithreading**: Writing programs that create and manage multiple threads to perform tasks simultaneously, such as handling multiple user requests in a web server or performing background tasks while keeping the main application responsive.
- **Synchronization**: Using mechanisms like mutexes, semaphores, and locks to manage access to shared resources and avoid race conditions.

## Threads vs processes

Threads and processes are both fundamental units of execution in an operating system, but they have key differences:

### Processes:

- **Independent**: Processes are completely independent of each other. They have their own memory space, resources, and execution context.
- **Heavyweight**: Creating and managing processes is relatively resource-intensive due to the overhead of setting up separate memory spaces and context switching between them.
- **Communication**: Communication between processes usually requires inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms, which can be slower and more complex.

### Threads:

- **Lightweight**: Threads are lighter weight than processes because they share the same memory space and resources within a process.
- **Efficient**: Creating and managing threads is more efficient than processes due to the shared resources and reduced overhead.
- **Communication**: Threads can communicate directly with each other through shared memory, making communication faster and simpler.


| Features      | Process               | Thread              |
|---------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Memory space  | Separate memory space | Shared memory space |
| Resources     | Separate resources    | Shared resources    |
| Communication | IPC mechanisms        | Shared memory       |
| Communication | Independent           | Belong to the same process |


```bash
ps -eLf
```

This command will show a list of all processes and threads, along with their PIDs (process IDs) and TIDs.

When using `ps -eLf`, you can differentiate between threads and processes by looking at the following fields:

1. **PID (Process ID)**: This is a unique identifier for each process. All threads within a process will share the same PID.
2. **LWP (LightWeight Process)**: This is also known as the Thread ID (TID). Each thread within a process has a unique LWP.

### Example:

Let's say the output of `ps -eLf` looks like this:

```bash
UID        PID  PPID   LWP   C NLWP STIME TTY      TIME CMD
user       1234  123   1234  0   1  10:00 pts/0    0:00 /bin/bash
user       1234  123   1235  0   1  10:00 pts/0    0:00 /bin/bash
```

In this example:

- There is one process with PID 1234.
- This process has two threads:
    - The main thread with LWP 1234
    - Another thread with LWP 1235

Both threads share the same PID (1234), but they have different LWPs (1234 and 1235).

#### NOTE:

PPID stands for Parent Process ID. In the context of operating systems like Linux, every process has a unique identifier called the Process ID (PID). When a new process is created by another process (the parent), the new process is assigned a PPID, which is the PID of its parent process.

In the output of `ps -eLf`, the PPID column shows the parent process ID for each process and thread listed. This helps you understand the relationship between processes, as you can trace back the hierarchy of processes that were created.

**Example**:

```bash
UID        PID  PPID   LWP   C NLWP STIME TTY      TIME CMD
root         1     0     1   0    1  08:00 ?        0:01 /sbin/init
root       123     1   123   0    1  08:01 ?        0:00 /usr/sbin/cron
user      1234  123   1234   0    1  08:02 pts/0    0:00 /bin/bash
```

In this example:

- Process 1 (`/sbin/init`) has a PPID of 0, indicating it's the initial process started by the system.
- Process 123 (`/usr/sbin/cron`) has a PPID of 1, meaning it was started by the `init` process.
- Process 1234 (`/bin/bash`) has a PPID of 123, meaning it was started by the `cron` process.

By examining the PPIDs, you can understand how processes are related to each other in a parent-child hierarchy.
