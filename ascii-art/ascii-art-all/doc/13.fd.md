## File Descriptors

In Linux (and other Unix-like systems), a file descriptor (FD) is simply a non-negative integer. It acts as a unique handle that a process uses to identify and interact with an open file or resource.

A file descriptor doesn't hold the file data itself; it's a reference that the kernel uses to manage the open resource.

### Key Points about File Descriptors

- **Everything is a File**: Linux treats almost everything as a file. This includes:
    - Regular files (documents, images, etc.)
        Directories
    - Network sockets
    - Hardware devices (like your terminal, keyboard, or disk drives)
- **Standard File Descriptors**: By default, every process starts with three open file descriptors:
    - 0: Standard Input (stdin) – usually your keyboard
    - 1: Standard Output (stdout) – usually your terminal screen
    - 2: Standard Error (stderr) – also typically your terminal screen
- **File Descriptor Table**: Each process maintains a table of its open file descriptors. The FD is an index into this table.
```md
Index (FD) | Pointer to Open File Table Entry
-----------------------------------------
     0     |        -> Entry for stdin
     1     |        -> Entry for stdout
     2     |        -> Entry for stderr
     3     |        -> Entry for example.txt (from our Go code)
     ...   |        -> ... 
```
