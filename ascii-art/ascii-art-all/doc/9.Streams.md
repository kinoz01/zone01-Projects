## Standard Streams

> Every process has three standard streams:  
    1. **Standard Input (`Stdin`)**: Where the process reads input.  
    2. **Standard Output (`Stdout`)**: Where the process sends its normal output.  
    3. **Standard Error (`Stderr`)**: Where the process sends error messages.

In a typical terminal, all three usually appear in the same window.

### More About `Process`

In the context of operating systems and programming, a **process** is a fundamental concept representing a running instance of a computer program. When you execute a program (like a web browser, text editor, or even a command in the terminal), the operating system creates a new process to manage its execution.

Each process has its own:

1. **Memory Space**: An area of memory allocated to hold the program's code, data, and the current state of its execution.
2. **System Resources**: Access to various system resources like files, network connections, and hardware devices.
3. **Execution Context**: Information about where the process is in its execution, including the values of variables and the next instruction to be executed.

**Standard Streams and Processes**

Now, coming back to standard streams:

- Every process, by default, is given three standard streams (stdin, stdout, stderr) as communication channels between the process and its environment (which could be the terminal, another process, or even a file).

- These streams are represented as file descriptors (integers) within the process. The operating system usually associates them with the terminal by default, but they can be redirected to other files or pipes.

#### Examples

1. **Interactive Shell**: When you type commands in a terminal, you're interacting with a shell process. Your keystrokes are sent to the shell's `stdin`, the shell's output appears on `stdout`, and any errors it encounters go to `stderr`.

2. **Piping Commands**: When you use the pipe (`|`) symbol to connect commands (e.g., `ls | grep file.txt`), you're creating a new process for each command, and the stdout of the first process is connected to the stdin of the second.

3. **File Redirection**: When you use `>` or `>>` to redirect output to a file, you're essentially telling the process to write its `stdout` (or `stderr`) to a file instead of the terminal.
