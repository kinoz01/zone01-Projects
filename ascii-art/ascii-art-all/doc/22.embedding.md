## Embedding

### Core Concept

Go's embed package (introduced in Go 1.16) allows you to bundle external resources (files, folders) directly into your compiled Go binary. This is handy for:

- **Self-contained Applications**: No need to distribute extra files alongside your executable.
- **Simplified Resource Access**: Read embedded data as easily as accessing variables in your code.
- **Improved Portability**: Everything you need is neatly packaged together.
- **Bundling assets** like HTML, CSS, JS files, or configuration files into a single executable.

### Key Mechanism: `//go:embed` Directive

The magic happens with the `//go:embed` directive. You place this special comment right above a variable declaration to specify which resources to embed.

### Example 1: Embedding a Single File

```go
package main

import (
    "embed"
    "fmt"
)

//go:embed sample.txt
var fileData string

func main() {
    fmt.Println(fileData) 
}
```

- Explanation:
    - `//go:embed sample.txt`: Tells Go to embed the contents of sample.txt (located in the same directory as your Go source code) into the `fileData` variable as a string.
    - In your code, you can use `fileData` like a regular string to access the embedded file's contents.

### Example 2: Embedding a Folder

```go
package main

import (
    "embed"
    "io/fs"
    "fmt"
)

//go:embed templates/*
var templateFS embed.FS

func main() {
    data, _ := fs.ReadFile(templateFS, "templates/greet.html")
    fmt.Println(string(data)) 
}
```

- Explanation:
    - `//go:embed templates/*`: Embeds the entire templates folder and its contents.
    - `embed.FS` is a special type representing an embedded filesystem.
    - `fs.ReadFile`: Reads the contents of the embedded `greet.html` file within the `templates` directory.

### Important Notes:

- **File Paths**: The paths in `//go:embed` are relative to the directory containing your Go source file.
- **`fs.ReadFile`**: To read files within the embedded folder (`folderFS`), you use the `fs.ReadFile` function, providing the `embed.FS `variable and the path to the file relative to the embedded folder's root.
- **Variable Types**:
    - Single files: `string`, `[]byte`
    - Folders: `embed.FS`
- **Error Handling**: Always check for errors when reading embedded data. The examples here have simplified error handling for brevity.
- **Wildcards**: You can use `*` for wildcard matching (e.g., `//go:embed images/*.png`).
- **Advanced Usage**:
    - You can embed multiple files/folders by listing them on separate lines after `//go:embed`.
    - Check out the `embed` package documentation for even more options.


### `fs.ReadFile` Usage and Details

Why writing :
```go
data, err := fs.ReadFile(templateFS, "templates/index.html")
```

can't we just write this: (since we already embedded the `templates` folder)
```go
data, err := fs.ReadFile(templateFS, "index.html")
```

#### Understanding the Embedded Filesystem Structure

> Think of `embed.FS` like a miniature file system that exists within your Go program. It holds the structure and contents of the embedded folder, allowing you to navigate through its files and directories.

When you embed a folder using `//go:embed templates`, the `templateFS` variable represents the entire embedded file system, starting from the root of the embedded folder. This means the embedded folder's original structure is preserved within `templateFS`.

In your case, "templates" is the name of the embedded folder itself. Therefore, to access a file within that folder, you must provide the full path relative to the root of the embedded file system, which is "templates/index.html" in your example.

If you were to use `fs.ReadFile(templateFS, "index.html")`, the function would search for "index.html" directly at the root of the embedded file system. Since the file is actually located within the "templates" subdirectory, it wouldn't be found.

> The path you provide to `fs.ReadFile` (or other `fs` package functions) is always relative to the root of the embedded file system (`templateFS`).


#### embed features in subfolders/packages?

You can keep the templates folder in the main folder and embed them from there. Then you need to inject the FS variable into the other handler package.

```go
package main

//go:embed templates/*
var templateFs embed.FS

func main() {
    handlers.TemplateFs = templateFs
...
```

```go
package handlers

var TemplateFs embed.FS

func handlerIndex() {
    ...
    tmpl, err = tmpl.ParseFS(TemplateFs, "templates/layout.gohtml",...
...
```

### Some Details About Embedding

At a low level, the embedded files within an `embed.FS` are represented as binary data (`bytes`). This data is typically stored within the read-only data segment of your Go executable.

Here's a simplified breakdown of how it works under the hood:

1. **Compilation**:
    - The Go compiler processes the `//go:embed` directives and reads the specified files from disk.
    - It converts the file contents into raw byte slices (`[]byte`).
    - Metadata about the embedded files (names, sizes, directory structure) is also encoded.
    - This data (bytes and metadata) is packaged into the executable file.

2. **Executable Structure**:
    - The executable contains a section (usually the ".rodata" section) where this embedded file data resides.
    - The `embed.FS` instance itself is a Go struct that references this section of memory.

3. **Runtime**:
    - When you access an embedded file using `embed.FS`, it:
        - Looks up the file's metadata (using its name).
        - Determines the byte offset within the embedded data section where the file's content starts.
        - Reads the raw bytes directly from memory.
        - If necessary, decodes or interprets the bytes based on the file type (e.g., text, image, etc.).

> You can search for content inside your executable using: 
```bash
xxd <your_executable> | grep <your_string_or_hex_pattern>
```

#### Note About `.rodata`
The `.rodata` section often contains string literals and other constants used by your program. By extracting and examining this section, you can gain insights into the data embedded within your executable.  The combination of xxd (for hexadecimal representation) and `grep` (for pattern matching) provides a powerful way to search this binary data effectively.

1. Use `objdump` to extract just the contents of the `.rodata` section to a separate file:
```bash
objdump -s -j .rodata your_executable > rodata_dump.txt
```

2. Use `xxd` to convert the extracted `.rodata` data into a hexadecimal dump:
```bash
xxd rodata_dump.txt
```

3. Now, you can use `grep` on this hex dump to find your target string or pattern:
```bash
xxd rodata_dump.txt | grep <your_string_or_hex_pattern>
```
