## `unsafe.Pointer`

In Go, `unsafe.Pointer` is a special type of pointer. Unlike regular pointers (e.g., `*int`, `*string`), it's not associated with any specific data type. Think of it as a "raw" or "generic" pointer that can hold the memory address of any value.

Go's `unsafe.Pointer` is the equivalent of a `void*` pointer in C. It allows Go programs to seamlessly interface with C libraries or low-level system calls, where generic pointers are often used to pass around data of varying types.

### Example 1

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"reflect"
	"unsafe"
)

func main() {
	i := 10
	iptr := unsafe.Pointer(&i)
	fmt.Println(reflect.TypeOf(i)) // print the type of i
	fmt.Println(iptr)			// print a memory address
	fmt.Println((*int)(iptr))   // print the same memory address
    fmt.Println(*(*int)(iptr))  // print i value
    fmt.Println(*(*string)(iptr)) // print fault error
}
```

#### Key points

> When you use `unsafe.Pointer` in Go, you are essentially treating the memory address as an "unsafe" memory location that can be interpreted or dereferenced as any type of data.  
`unsafe.Pointer(&i)` this line basically tells the compiler to ignore type safety checks: Normally, Go's compiler strictly enforces type safety. It would prevent you from using a pointer to an integer to access a string, for example. However, `unsafe.Pointer` bypasses these type checks, allowing you to treat the memory at that address as if it could hold any kind of data.

- using `fmt.Println(*(iptr))` won't work now because:  
- The `*` operator in Go is used to dereference a pointer, which means accessing the value stored at the memory address it points to. However, you cannot directly dereference an `unsafe.Pointer`. It's a generic pointer that doesn't know the type of data it's pointing to.  
- To print the value pointed to by `iptr`, you need to do two things:

    1. Convert to a Typed Pointer:  You must first convert `iptr` back into a pointer of the correct type. This is typically done using a type assertion:
    ```go
    iValue := (*int)(iptr) 
    ```
    2. Now `iValue` is a pointer to an integer, and you can safely dereference it and print its value:
    ```go
    fmt.Println(*iValue) 
    ```

- You can also for example use this: `fmt.Println(*(*float64)(iptr))` but you might end up with a fault panic or a completely different number, potentially something like `1.0635374e-314`

### Example 2: Pointer Arithmetic

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

func main() {
	arr := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
	arrPtr := unsafe.Pointer(&arr[0])
	next := (*int)(unsafe.Pointer(uintptr(arrPtr) + unsafe.Sizeof(arr[0])))
    fmt.Printf("%v\n", *next)
}
```

#### Key points

- `arrPtr := unsafe.Pointer(&arr[0])`: Converts the address of the first element of the array `(&arr[0])` to an `unsafe.Pointer`.

- `uintptr(arrPtr)`: Converts the `unsafe.Pointer` to a `uintptr`, which is an integer type that can be used for pointer arithmetic.

- `unsafe.Sizeof(arr[0])`: Returns the size in bytes of the type of the first element in the array (`arr[0]`). Since `arr[0]` is an `int`, this returns the size of an `int`.

- `uintptr(arrPtr) + unsafe.Sizeof(arr[0])`: Adds the size of one `int` to the pointer value, effectively moving the pointer to the next element in the array.

- `unsafe.Pointer(...)`: Converts the resulting `uintptr` back to an `unsafe.Pointer`.

- `(*int)(unsafe.Pointer(...))`: Casts the `unsafe.Pointer` to a `*int`, a pointer to an integer.

- we can put `2 * unsafe.Sizeof(arr[0])` to get to the next element of the array which is 3 in this case, and so on.

### Example 3

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"unsafe"
)

func main() {
	i := 42
	fmt.Println("Original value:", i)

	// Get an unsafe pointer to i
	iptr := unsafe.Pointer(&i)

	// Convert the unsafe pointer to a pointer to float64
	fptr := (*float64)(iptr)

	// Modify the value using the float64 pointer
	*fptr = 3.14

	// Print the modified value
	fmt.Println("Modified value (interpreted as int):", i)
	fmt.Println("Modified value (interpreted as float64):", *fptr)
}
```

- **`Unsafe Pointer` Manipulation**: The memory address of `i` is treated as a `float64` and modified to `3.14`.

- *Modified value (interpreted as int)*: The binary representation of 3.14 as a `float64` (which is `0x40091EB851EB851F` in hexadecimal) is interpreted as a large integer `4614253070214989087`.
