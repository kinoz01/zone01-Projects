# Golang File System (fs) API

The Go programming language offers a rich standard library for file system operations. The core package for these operations is the `os` package, which provides basic functionality for interacting with the file system. Additionally, the `io/ioutil` package offers utility functions, and the `path/filepath` package aids in handling file path manipulations.

## OS Tools

### 1. File Operations

#### Opening and Reading Files

- `os.Open`: Opens a file for reading. Returns an `os.File` pointer.

```go
file, err := os.Open("filename")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
defer file.Close()
```

- `os.File.Read`: Reads data from the file.

```go
buffer := make([]byte, 100)
count, err := file.Read(buffer)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
fmt.Printf("Read %d bytes: %s\n", count, buffer[:count])
```

#### Creating and Writing to Files

- `os.Create`: Creates a file for writing. If the file already exists, it truncates it.

```go
file, err := os.Create("filename")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
defer file.Close()
```

- `os.File.Write`: Writes data to the file.

```go
_, err = file.Write([]byte("Hello, World!"))
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

#### Reading and Writing Files with Convenience Functions

- `os.ReadFile`: Reads the entire content of a file into a byte slice.

```go
data, err := os.ReadFile("filename")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
fmt.Println(string(data))
```

- `os.WriteFile`: Writes a byte slice to a file.

```go
err = os.WriteFile("filename", []byte("Hello, World!"), 0644)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

#### File Information

- `os.Stat`: Returns file information.

```go
fileInfo, err := os.Stat("filename")
if err != nil {
     // handle error
}
fmt.Println("File size:", fileInfo.Size())
fmt.Println("File mode:", fileInfo.Mode())
fmt.Println("File mod time:", fileInfo.ModTime())
```

#### Removing Files

- `os.Remove`: Deletes a file.

```go
err := os.Remove("filename")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

### 2. Directory Operations

#### Creating Directories

- `os.Mkdir`: Creates a single directory.

```go
err := os.Mkdir("dirname", 0755)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

- `os.MkdirAll`: Creates a directory and all necessary parents.

```go
err := os.MkdirAll("path/to/dir", 0755)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

#### Reading Directories

- `os.ReadDir`: Reads the contents of a directory.

```go
entries, err := os.ReadDir("dirname")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
for _, entry := range entries {
    fmt.Println(entry.Name(), entry.IsDir())
}
```

### 3. Process Management

#### Executing External Commands

- `os.Exec`: Executes an external command.

```go
cmd := exec.Command("ls", "-l")
output, err := cmd.CombinedOutput()
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
fmt.Println(string(output))
```

#### Getting Process Information

- `os.Getpid`: Gets the process ID.

```go
pid := os.Getpid()
fmt.Println("Process ID:", pid)
```

- `os.Getppid`: Gets the parent process ID.

```go
ppid := os.Getppid()
fmt.Println("Parent Process ID:", ppid)
```

### 4. Environment Variables
#### Getting Environment Variables

- `os.Getenv`: Gets the value of an environment variable.

```go
path := os.Getenv("PATH")
fmt.Println("PATH:", path)
```

- `os.Environ`: Returns a slice of all environment variables.

```go
envVars := os.Environ()
for _, envVar := range envVars {
    fmt.Println(envVar)
}
```

#### Setting Environment Variables

- `os.Setenv`: Sets the value of an environment variable.

```go
err := os.Setenv("MY_VAR", "my_value")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

## From `OS` to `Syscall`

Let's delve into how the `os` package in Go works at a lower level. This involves understanding how Go interfaces with the operating system through system calls, which are the fundamental way programs interact with the operating system.

### Low-Level Overview of the os Package

1. **System Calls**
    - System calls are the primary interface between an application and the operating system.
    - When you perform operations like reading a file or creating a directory in Go, these actions are translated into system calls by the Go runtime.
    - Each operating system provides a set of system calls for file manipulation, process control, and other operations.

2. **Go's `syscall` Package**
    - Go has a `syscall` package that provides low-level interface to the operating system's system calls.
    - The `os` package is built on top of this `syscall` package, providing a more user-friendly API.

3. **File Operations Example**

    - When you open a file using os.Open, internally, Go uses the `syscall.Open` function.

    - Here's a simplified view of how this works:

```go
package main

import (
     "os"
    "syscall"
)

func main() {
    // High-level API call
    file, err := os.Open("example.txt")
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
        }
        defer file.Close()
    }
```

The `os.Open` function is part of the os package, which internally calls the `syscall.Open` function to perform the actual system call.

4. **Error Handling**
    - System calls often return error codes which are converted into Go's error type.
    - For instance, if a file does not exist, the `syscall.Open` call will return an error code like `ENOENT` (error no entry), which the `os` package converts into a more readable error message.

5. **Process Management**
    - Similar to file operations, process-related functions in the `os` package use system calls under the hood.
    - Functions like `os.Exec `internally use `syscall.Exec` to create and manage processes.

6. **Concurrency and Goroutines**
    - Go's runtime handles concurrency through goroutines, which are managed by the Go scheduler.
    - When performing blocking I/O operations, the **Go runtime** can manage other goroutines to ensure the application remains responsive.

### Detailed Example

Here's a detailed example illustrating how the `os` package works with lower-level system calls:

#### Example: Opening a File

1. **Using os Package**

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "os"
)

func main() {
    file, err := os.Open("example.txt")
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
        return
    }
    defer file.Close()
    fmt.Println("File opened successfully")
}
```

2. **Internal Mechanism**

- `os.Open`:
    - Calls `openFile` function in `os` package.
    - `openFile` uses `syscall.Open` to perform the actual system call.

```go
// os/file.go
func Open(name string) (*File, error) {
    return OpenFile(name, O_RDONLY, 0)
}

// os/file_unix.go
func OpenFile(name string, flag int, perm FileMode) (*File, error) {
    r, errf := openFileNolog(name, flag, perm)
    if errf == nil {
        return r, nil
    }
    return nil, &PathError{Op: "open", Path: name, Err: errf}
}

func openFileNolog(name string, flag int, perm FileMode) (file *File, err error) {
    r, e := syscall.Open(name, flag, syscallMode(perm))
    if e != nil {
        return nil, e
    }
    return newFile(r, name), nil
}
```

- `syscall.Open`:
    - Directly interacts with the operating system's file system to open the file.
    - This is where the actual system call happens.

```go
// syscall/syscall_unix.go
func Open(path string, mode int, perm uint32) (fd int, err error) {
    var _p0 *byte
    _p0, err = BytePtrFromString(path)
    if err != nil {
        return
    }
    r0, _, e1 := Syscall(SYS_OPEN, uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(_p0)), uintptr(mode), uintptr(perm))
    fd = int(r0)
    if e1 != 0 {
        err = errnoErr(e1)
    }
    return
}
```

## From `Syscall` to `asm`

### Understanding System Calls

System calls are the primary mechanism through which user-space applications interact with the operating system kernel. They provide an interface for performing operations such as file I/O, process control, and networking. When a system call is made, the control of execution is transferred from user space to kernel space, where the actual operation is performed.

### Low-Level Mechanism of System Calls

1. **User Space vs. Kernel Space**
    - **User Space**: The memory space where user applications run. These applications are restricted from performing certain operations directly on hardware or system resources.
    - **Kernel Space**: The memory space where the kernel runs. It has unrestricted access to system resources and hardware.

2. **Making a System Call**
    - When a system call is made, the program switches from user mode to kernel mode.
    - This involves setting up the necessary parameters for the system call, placing them in specific registers or on the stack, and then executing a special instruction that triggers the switch to kernel mode.

3. **Executing a System Call**
    - In kernel mode, the operating system kernel handles the request. It performs the required operation (e.g., reading from a file, allocating memory) and then returns control back to the user space, along with the result of the operation.

### How Syscall Works Under the Hood

1. **Setting Up Parameters**
    - The parameters for the system call are prepared and placed in specific CPU registers or on the stack.

2. **Triggering the System Call**
    - A special CPU instruction (e.g., `INT 0x80` on `x86`, `SYSENTER` on modern x86) is executed. This instruction triggers a software interrupt, switching the CPU to kernel mode and jumping to a predefined location in the kernel.

3. **Handling the System Call in the Kernel**
    - The kernel has a system call handler that inspects the parameters, determines which system call is being requested (via a syscall number), and dispatches the request to the appropriate kernel function.

4. **Returning to User Space**
    - Once the kernel has completed the operation, it places the result (or an error code) in the appropriate register and executes a return-from-interrupt instruction. This switches the CPU back to user mode and resumes execution of the user application.

### Example in Assembly (Linux x86)

Here's a simplified view of what happens at the assembly level when making a system call in Linux on an x86 architecture:

```asm
section .data
    msg db 'Hello, World!', 0

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; syscall number for write (1) is placed in eax
    mov eax, 4       ; syscall number for sys_write
    mov ebx, 1       ; file descriptor (stdout)
    mov ecx, msg     ; pointer to the message
    mov edx, 13      ; length of the message
    int 0x80         ; trigger interrupt to call kernel

    ; exit the program
    mov eax, 1       ; syscall number for sys_exit
    xor ebx, ebx     ; exit code 0
    int 0x80         ; trigger interrupt to call kernel
```
