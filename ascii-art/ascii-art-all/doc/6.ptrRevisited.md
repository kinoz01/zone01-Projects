## Pointers Revisited

When we say that `address1` and `address2` "point to the same memory location," it means that both variables hold the same memory address. In other words, they both reference the same location in memory.

Here's a breakdown of what this means:

1. **Memory Address**: A memory address is a specific location in the computer's memory where data is stored. Each memory address is a unique identifier for a specific byte (or group of bytes) in the memory.

2. **Pointer**: In programming, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Instead of holding a data value directly, a pointer holds the address of where the data is stored in memory.

3. **Pointing to the Same Memory Address**: When two pointers point to the same memory address, it means they both hold the same value, which is the address of a specific location in memory. Consequently, any changes made to the data at that memory address via one pointer will be reflected when accessed via the other pointer.
