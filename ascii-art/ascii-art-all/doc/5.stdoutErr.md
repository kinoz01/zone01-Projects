## `syscall.Stdout` Cat Error

```go
_, _, err := syscall.Syscall(syscall.SYS_IOCTL, uintptr(syscall.Stdout), syscall.TIOCGWINSZ, uintptr(unsafe.Pointer(&dimensions)))
```

- Running the program `go run . example | cat -e` using `stdout` (or `1`) will give an error:

```bash
Error: inappropriate ioctl for device
```

The `ioctl` system call (used within `Syscall`) requires a file descriptor as its second argument to specify which resource to manipulate. In this case, we want to get information about the terminal window, which is where standard output (`stdout`) is directed.

However, when you pipe the output of your Go program to `cat -e` using `|`, you change the destination of `stdout`. It's no longer the terminal window but the input of the `cat` command. So, using `uintptr(1)` (stdout) in the `ioctl` call wouldn't make sense; it's trying to get window size information from the writing end of the pipe, which isn't associated with a terminal window.

### Why `uintptr(2)` Always Works

When stdout is redirected to a pipe, `stderr` typically always remains connected to the terminal. This is why `uintptr(2)` (stderr) works in both scenarios (`| cat -e` and `go test`). The `ioctl` call operates on the `stderr` stream, which is still linked to the terminal, allowing it to successfully retrieve the window size information.
