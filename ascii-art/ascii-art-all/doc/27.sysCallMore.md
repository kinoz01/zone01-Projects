## Under the Hood of syscall.Syscall

The `syscall.Syscall` function is a fundamental building block for making system calls in Go. Here's a simplified view of what it does:

1. **Assembly Trap**: It triggers a special instruction called a "trap" that switches execution from your Go program to the operating system kernel. This trap is the doorway to the kernel's protected domain. This is a privileged mode where the kernel has full access to the system's hardware and resources.

2. **System Call Number**:  The first argument to `syscall.Syscall` is the system call number. This is a unique identifier that tells the kernel which specific service your program is requesting. In our case, we use `syscall.SYS_IOCTL`, which represents the `ioctl` system call.

3. **Arguments**: The remaining arguments to `syscall.Syscall` are passed to the kernel's system call handler. These arguments vary depending on the specific system call. For `ioctl`, we typically pass:
    - The file descriptor (in our case, `2`, representing standard error)
    - The `ioctl` request code (`syscall.TIOCGWINSZ` in our example)
    - A pointer to a memory location where the kernel can store the result (more on this below)

4. **Kernel Execution**: The kernel takes over, executes the requested system call, and places the result in the provided memory location.

5. **Return to Go**: Execution returns to your Go program, and syscall.Syscall returns the values provided by the kernel. In our example, we ignore the first two return values and focus on the potential error value.

#### The `TIOCGWINSZ` `Ioctl` Request

`TIOCGWINSZ` is a special code that instructs the ioctl system call to fetch the terminal window size information. When the kernel receives this request, it does the following:

1. **Locate Terminal Data**: The kernel finds the internal data structure that tracks the current terminal's size.

2. **Copy Data to Memory**: It copies the relevant data (number of rows and columns) from its internal structure into the memory location provided by your Go program. This is the memory location pointed to by the `&dimensions` argument in our example. It writes the row and column values into the memory location pointed to by `&dimensions`. Since your Go array matches the `winsize` structure's layout, the data is written correctly.

3. Update Go Structure: Since our `dimensions` array is defined with the correct `uint16` type, the values copied by the kernel fit perfectly into the array, effectively updating it with the terminal's dimensions.

**Putting It Together**

In essence, when you call `syscall.Syscall` with `TIOCGWINSZ`, you're sending a message to the kernel saying: "Hey, please look up the current terminal size and put that information at this memory address." The kernel obliges, and your Go program then reads the updated values from the `dimensions` array.


### Why the `GetTerminalWidth()` works only with `uint16` type in `dimensions` table?

```go
var dimensions [2]uint16
```

When using `uint16` in Go, the data structure created in memory matches the specific memory layout expected by certain system calls (`syscalls`), such as `TIOCGWINSZ` for getting the terminal window size. This alignment ensures that the data passed to the system call is correctly interpreted by the underlying operating system. Here's a more detailed explanation of why this works:

System calls often interact directly with the kernel, which expects data structures to be in a specific format. For the `TIOCGWINSZ` ioctl (I/O control) call, the kernel expects a `winsize` structure that looks like this in C:

```C
struct winsize {
    unsigned short ws_row;    /* rows, in characters */
    unsigned short ws_col;    /* columns, in characters */
    unsigned short ws_xpixel; /* horizontal size, pixels */
    unsigned short ws_ypixel; /* vertical size, pixels */
};
```

In this structure:

- `unsigned short` is a 16-bit unsigned integer (`uint16_t` in C).
- The structure contains four fields, each of 16 bits.

> The memory layout of the Go `uint16` array matches the memory layout expected by the C `winsize` structure.
When `TIOCGWINSZ` reads the `dimensions` array, it correctly interprets the first 2 bytes as `ws_row`, the next 2 bytes as `ws_col`, and so on.

**Kernel's View of `winsize` Structure**
```bash
| ws_row  (16 bits) | ws_col  (16 bits) | ws_xpixel (16 bits) | ws_ypixel (16 bits) |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
|      2 bytes      |      2 bytes      |       2 bytes       |       2 bytes       |
```

**`dimensions` Array in Go**
```bash
| dimensions[0] (uint16) | dimensions[1] (uint16) | dimensions[2] (uint16) | dimensions[3] (uint16) |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
|        2 bytes         |        2 bytes         |        2 bytes         |        2 bytes         |
```

By using `uint16`, the Go structure aligns perfectly with what the `TIOCGWINSZ` syscall expects. This alignment ensures that the data is correctly interpreted by the kernel, which relies on the specific memory layout to retrieve the terminal dimensions.

### C's Influence on System Calls

Many operating systems, including Unix-like systems (like Linux and macOS) that Go often runs on, are written primarily in C.  This means that the interfaces for making system calls are often defined in C. These interfaces include:

- **Function Names**: The names of the system call functions (e.g., `ioctl`)
- **Argument Types**: The types of data that the system call functions expect (e.g., file descriptors, ioctl request codes, data structures)

#### The C Connection in Our Example

In our example, the `TIOCGWINSZ` ioctl request is part of the C standard library for terminal control. This means that the kernel expects the data structure passed to this request to match the C structure definition we discussed earlier (`struct winsize`).

By using `uint16` in our Go code, we ensure that our data structure matches the memory layout that the C-based kernel expects. This allows our Go program to communicate effectively with the kernel, even though Go and C are different languages.


#### Where the `winsize` Structure Lives?

The `winsize` structure is defined in a header file called `termios.h`. This header file is part of the C standard library, which is a collection of essential functions and definitions used by C programs.

When you include `termios.h` in your C code (or indirectly through other headers), the compiler brings in the definition of `winsize`. This makes the structure available for your program to use.

The Kernel's Awareness of `winsize`

While the kernel doesn't directly define the `winsize` structure, it's aware of its layout. This is because the kernel's developers designed the `TIOCGWINSZ` `ioctl` request specifically to work with this structure.

Think of it like a shared language:

- **C Standard Library**: Provides the vocabulary (the `winsize` structure definition).
- **Kernel**: Knows the grammar (how to interpret the `winsize` structure) and uses it for communication.
- **User-Space Programs** (Golang): Use the same vocabulary and grammar to exchange information with the kernel.
