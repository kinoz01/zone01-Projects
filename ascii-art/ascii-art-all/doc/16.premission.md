## Octal Notation and File Permissions

In the code 
```go
err := os.WriteFile(outputFileName, []byte(output), 0666)
```

the `0666` represents the file permissions (also known as file mode) in *octal notation*. Here's a breakdown of what it means:

- Octal: Octal is a base-8 number system, using digits 0-7. It's often used for file permissions because each digit corresponds to three bits (000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111) which can represent the read (r), write (w), and execute (x) permissions for different user classes.

- File Permissions: In Unix-like systems, file permissions determine who can read, write, and/or execute a file. There are three user classes:
    - User (Owner): The person who created the file.
    - Group: A set of users associated with the file.
    - Other: Everyone else.

In octal notation, the permissions are defined as follows:

- `4`: Read permission.
- `2`: Write permission.
- `1`: Execute permission.

Each digit represents a combination of these permissions:

- `7`: Read (4) + Write (2) + Execute (1) = 7
- `6`: Read (4) + Write (2) = 6
- `5`: Read (4) + Execute (1) = 5
- `4`: Read (4)
- `3`: Write (2) + Execute (1) = 3
- `2`: Write (2)
- `1`: Execute (1)
- `0`: No permissions

Important Considerations:

- Umask: The actual permissions applied might be modified by the system's "umask" value, which masks out certain permissions.
- Platform Differences: File permission behavior can vary slightly between operating systems (e.g., Windows vs. Unix-like).

Alternatives:

If you want more fine-grained control over file permissions, you can use the `os.FileMode` type.

### Binary Representation of Permissions

In Unix-like operating systems (like Linux and macOS), file permissions are often represented using three bits for each user class (owner, group, others). Each bit corresponds to a specific permission:

- **Bit 0 (Least Significant Bit)**: Execute permission (x)
- **Bit 1**: Write permission (w)
- **Bit 2 (Most Significant Bit)**: Read permission (r)

So, for example:

- `100` (binary) = `4` (octal) represents read-only permission.
- `010` (binary) = `2` (octal) represents write-only permission.
- `101` (binary) = `5` (octal) represents read and execute permissions.
- `111` (binary) = `7` (octal) represents read, write, and execute permissions.
