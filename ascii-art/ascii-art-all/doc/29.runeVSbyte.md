## Rune vs Byte

**Fundamental Concept**

- `byte` (`uint8`): A `byte` is the basic unit of storage in computing, representing an 8-bit numerical value (0 to 255). In Go, `byte` is an alias for `uint8`. It's primarily used to manipulate raw, binary data or text encoded in ASCII.

- `rune` (`int32`): A `rune` is an alias for `int32` and represents a Unicode "code point." Unicode is a universal standard for representing characters from all languages worldwide. A `rune` can therefore represent any character, including accented letters, emojis, Chinese symbols, etc.

**Usage**

- `byte`:
    - Manipulating binary data (images, files, etc.)
    - Text encoded in ASCII only
    - Individual access to bytes within a string (but be careful with UTF-8!)

- `rune`:
    - Manipulating Unicode text (the majority of cases)
    - Correctly iterating over characters in a UTF-8 string
    - Using string manipulation libraries (which often work with runes)


### Summarize

- **Byte**: A byte is the fundamental building block of data in a computer. It can hold a value from 0 to 255. In the context of text, a single byte can represent a character in simple encodings like ASCII. However, with more complex encodings like UTF-8, a single character might require multiple bytes to represent it fully.

- **Rune**: A rune represents a single Unicode code point, which is essentially a unique number assigned to every character in the world's writing systems. A rune is guaranteed to represent a complete character, regardless of the underlying encoding used (e.g., UTF-8).

So, to reiterate:

- **One byte might not represent a whole character**. In UTF-8, some characters need 2, 3, or even 4 bytes.
- **One rune always represents a whole character**. It's designed to work seamlessly with Unicode.

### Examples:

**ASCII Character**
```go
char := 'a'  // The character 'a'
bytes := []byte(string(char)) // Convert to bytes

fmt.Println(bytes) // Output: [97]  (ASCII code for 'a')
```

**Accented Character**
```go
char := 'Ã©'  // The character 'Ã©'
bytes := []byte(string(char)) // Convert to bytes

fmt.Println(bytes) // Output: [195 169] 
```

**Emoji**
```go
char := 'ðŸ˜€' // Grinning face emoji
bytes := []byte(string(char)) // Convert to bytes

fmt.Println(bytes) // Output: [240 159 152 128]
```
