# `Struct`

>  In Go, a struct is a sequence of named elements called fields, each field has a name and type.
The name of a field must be unique within the struct.
Structs can be compared with classes in the Object-Oriented Programming paradigm.

> Field names in structs follow the Go convention:
	   fields whose name starts with a lower case letter
	   are only visible to code in the same package, whereas
	   those whose name starts with an upper case letter are
	   visible in other packages.

In Go, you can declare and initialize a struct in several ways, depending on your requirements for clarity, conciseness, and the need to specify field names. Let's assume we have the following struct definition for demonstration purposes:

```go
type Person struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
```

Here are the various ways to declare and initialize this `Person` struct:

## 1. Declaration without Initialization

Declare a `Person` variable without initializing it. This will set the fields to their zero values (empty string for `Name` and `0` for `Age`).

```go
    var p1 Person
```

## 2. Declaration with Initialization Using Field Names

Initialize a `Person` struct by specifying field names. Unspecified fields are set to their zero values. This method enhances code readability and allows setting fields in any order.

```go
    p2 := Person{Name: "Alice", Age: 30}
```

## 3. Declaration with Initialization Without Field Names

Initialize a `Person` struct without specifying field names. You must follow the order of fields as defined in the struct. It's less readable, especially with structs that have many fields.

```go
    p3 := Person{"Bob", 25}
```

## 4. Using the new Keyword

The `new` keyword creates a pointer to a struct, initializing all fields to their zero values.

```go
    p4 := new(Person)
    // Access fields using the pointer
    p4.Name = "Charlie"
    p4.Age = 20
```

## 5. Using a Pointer with Composite Literal

Similar to method 2, but returns a pointer to the struct. This is a concise way to create a struct and get a pointer to it without the explicit use of `new`.

```go
    p5 := &Person{Name: "Diane", Age: 35}
```

## 6. Initializing an Anonymous Struct

For one-off uses where you don't need to reuse the struct type, you can declare and initialize an anonymous struct.

```go
    p6 := struct {
        Name string
        Age  int
    }{
        Name: "Evan",
        Age:  40,
    }
```

## 7. Using a Constructor Function

While not a direct language feature for struct initialization, defining a constructor function is a common pattern. This is especially useful when initialization logic is non-trivial.

```go
    func NewPerson(name string, age int) *Person {
        return &Person{Name: name, Age: age}
    }

    p7 := NewPerson("Fiona", 28)
```

### Constructor function and pointers

You can define your constructor function to return a `Person` instance directly instead of a pointer to a `Person` instance. 
The choice between returning a struct or a pointer to a struct from a constructor function depends on several factors including performance considerations, the intended use of the object, and the semantics of your application.

**Returning a Struct**

If you return a struct directly:

```go
    func NewPerson(name string, age int) Person {
        return Person{name, age}
    }
```

In this case, each time `NewPerson` is called, a new `Person` instance is created and returned by value. This means that a copy of the `Person` struct is returned. If you pass this Person instance to other functions, or assign it to other variables, Go will create and work with copies of this data, not the original instance. This is perfectly fine for small structs or when you need the safety of immutable data.

**Returning a Pointer**

On the other hand, if you return a pointer to a struct:

```go
    func NewPerson(name string, age int) *Person {
         return &Person{name, age}
    }
```

This approach creates a new instance of Person and returns a pointer to it. This means that rather than copying the entire struct each time it's passed around, only the memory address (the pointer) is copied. The advantages of using a pointer are:

*Efficiency for Large Structs*: For large structs, returning and passing around pointers is more efficient than copying the structs multiple times.  
*Mutability*: If you want to modify the struct after it's created, having a pointer makes it clear that the function or method might modify the original struct, not a copy.   
*Consistency with nil Values*: Returning a pointer allows you to return `nil` to indicate failure or absence of an object, which is a common pattern in Go.


# `[]Struct`

```go
type Person []struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}
```

Here are various ways to declare and initialize a slice of `Person` structs:

## 1. Declaration without Initialization

```go
var people1 []Person
```

## 2. Declaration with Initialization Using Field Names

Initialize a slice of `Person` structs by specifying field names. This method enhances code readability and allows setting fields in any order.

```go
people2 := []Person{
    {Name: "Alice", Age: 30},
    {Name: "Bob", Age: 25},
}
```

## 3. Declaration with Initialization Without Field Names

Initialize a slice of `Person` structs without specifying field names. You must follow the order of fields as defined in the struct.

```go
people3 := []Person{
    {"Charlie", 20},
    {"Diane", 35},
}
```

## 4. Using the `make` Function

The `make` function creates a slice with a specified length and capacity.

```go
package main

type Person struct {
	Name string
	Age  int
}

func main() {
	people4 := make([]Person, 2)
	people4[0] = Person{Name: "Evan", Age: 40}
	people4[1] = Person{Name: "Fiona", Age: 28}
}
```

> Note that the one using `[]struct` is for a collection (`slice`) of `Person` objects, suitable when you need to store multiple people.
The one using `struct` is for a single `Person` object, suitable when you need to represent a single `person`, but we can also create a `slice` of that `struct` type to work with multiple person as we did above.

> Note that we are using a `struct` type not a `[]struct` to use the `[]struct` type you need to put:


```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Person []struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

func main() {
    people4 := make(Person, 2)
    
    people4[0] = struct {
        Name string
        Age  int
    }{
        Name: "Evan",
        Age:  40,
    }
    
    fmt.Println(people4[0])
    fmt.Println(people4)
}
```

> You can use `append` to populate the `Person` slice. When using `append`, you create new elements and add them to the slice. 


```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Person []struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}

func main() {
    var people4 Person
    
    // Append new elements to the slice
    people4 = append(people4, struct {
        Name string
        Age  int
    }{
        Name: "Evan",
        Age:  40,
    })
    
    people4 = append(people4, struct {
        Name string
        Age  int
    }{
        Name: "Fiona",
        Age:  28,
    })
    
    fmt.Println(people4)
}
```

## 5. Initializing a Slice with Anonymous Structs

For one-off uses where you don't need to reuse the struct type, you can declare and initialize a slice of anonymous structs.

```go
people5 := []struct {
    Name string
    Age  int
}{
    {Name: "Ivy", Age: 45},
    {Name: "Jack", Age: 50},
}
```

## 6. Using a Constructor Function to Create a Slice

Define a constructor function that returns a slice of `Person` structs. This is useful when initialization logic is non-trivial.

```go
func NewPeople(names []string, ages []int) []Person {
    if len(names) != len(ages) {
        panic("names and ages slices must have the same length")
    }
    people := make([]Person, len(names))
    for i := range names {
        people[i] = Person{Name: names[i], Age: ages[i]}
    }
    return people
}

people6 := NewPeople([]string{"Kate", "Leo"}, []int{33, 29})
```

### Note: Slices are reference types in Go.

> In Go, a slice is already a reference type, meaning it holds a reference to the underlying array. Therefore, in most cases, you do not need to use pointers to structs when working with slices. 

**Slices in Go: References to Arrays**

In Go, a slice is a lightweight data structure that describes a contiguous section of an underlying array. It consists of three components:

- **Pointer**: A pointer to the first element of the slice within the array.
- **Length**: The number of elements in the slice.
- **Capacity**: The maximum number of elements the slice can hold before needing to resize the underlying array.

Crucially, when you pass a slice to a function or assign it to a new variable, you're actually copying the **slice header** (pointer, length, and capacity). However, this header still points to the *same underlying array*. This means that any modifications made to the slice's elements within a function will affect the original slice.

**Why You Usually Don't Need Pointers to Slices**

- **Passing by Value is Enough**: Since slices are references, passing them by value allows the function to modify the original slice's contents.
- **Reslicing Creates New Headers**: If a function needs to change the length or capacity of a slice (e.g., with `append`), it can return the modified slice. The caller receives a new slice header but still operates on the same underlying data.

**When You Might Use Pointers to Slices**

There are a few scenarios where you might use pointers to slices:

- **Modifying the Slice Header Itself**: If you want a function to change the actual slice header (e.g., to nil out a slice), you need to pass a pointer to the slice.
- **Efficiency with Large Slices**: For very large slices, passing a pointer to the slice header can be slightly more efficient than copying the entire header. However, this is usually a micro-optimization and shouldn't be your primary concern.

**Example: Modifying Slice Elements**

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func modifySlice(s []int) {
    s[0] = 100
}

func main() {
    numbers := []int{1, 2, 3}
    modifySlice(numbers)
    fmt.Println(numbers) // Output: [100 2 3]
}
```

In this example, the modifySlice function receives a copy of the slice header but operates on the original underlying array, changing the first element to 100.

**Key Points**

- Slices are reference types in Go.
- Passing a slice to a function by value allows modifications to the underlying array.
- Pointers to slices are typically only needed for changing the slice header itself or for potential efficiency gains with very large slices.


**What do we mean by reference type?**
In Go, when we say slices are references, we mean they behave like a "label" or a "pointer" to an underlying array. A slice doesn't store the actual data elements directly; instead, it holds information that allows it to access and manipulate a portion of that underlying array.
