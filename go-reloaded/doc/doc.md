## fmt.Sscanf
`fmt.Sscanf` is a function from Go's fmt package. It reads formatted input from a string according to a specified format. The function signature is:

```go
func Sscanf(str string, format string, a ...interface{}) (n int, err error)
```

Here's what each parameter and return value represents:

- **str**: the input string to read from.
- **format**: a format string that specifies how the input should be interpreted.
- **a**: one or more pointers where the parsed values are stored.
- **n**: the number of items successfully parsed.
- **err**: any error encountered during parsing.

### Example:

```go
var dummy string
str := "Hello World"
n, err := fmt.Sscanf(str, "%s", &dummy)
```

In this snippet:

- `str`: This is the input string, which in your example is "Hello World".
- `"%s"`: The format string %s tells fmt.Sscanf to parse a sequence of non-whitespace characters.
- `&dummy`: This is a pointer to a variable where the parsed string will be stored.

**Expected Behavior:** 
When you execute this line with `str = "Hello World"`:

`fmt.Sscanf` will parse and store the first word "Hello" into the variable dummy.  
The parsing stops at the first whitespace, which is after "Hello". This is because `%s` only captures the sequence of characters until the first space.

**Results:**
- `dummy`: This will contain the string "Hello".
- `n`: This will be 1, indicating that one field was successfully parsed.
- `err`: This will be nil assuming no issues arose during parsing. However, it is important to note that since not the entire string was consumed, this doesn't necessarily mean everything went perfectly if your goal was to parse the whole string.

**Note: Using different format specifiers to capture the whole string:**

If your goal is to parse more than just the first word in a string, here are a few approaches you could use in Go:

- `%q` for Quoted Strings: 
This specifier is used to parse quoted strings, which can include spaces within the quotes. However, it's not suitable for unquoted input with spaces.

- `%[...]` Scanset:  
This allows you to specify a custom scanset. For example, using `%[^\n]` would read all characters up to (but not including) a newline character. This is useful if you expect your input to be a single line possibly containing spaces.
