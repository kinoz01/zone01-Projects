ok let me putyou in context here so you can helpme solve this problem and tell if my method can lead to something:

1. I have ants in a start room and i need to send them all to an end room thought a graph (channels) of rooms each room in the rÃ©seau can have only one ant at a time.

2. what i do is getting all the possible paths from start to end using dfs

3. next filtering them using the above filter code so i get max minimal path that don't intersect.

4. THE PROBLEM:

If number of ants%<number of paths  returned by the filter>=0

this way work greatly 

but when number of ants%<number of paths  returned by the filter>!=0

i need to find new paths

so what i am doing is sending antsNum-antsNUm%filteredpaths in the filtered path and for the remaining ants i am trying to find the best way to send them

for example:
```
