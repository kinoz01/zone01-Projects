## Definition

"localhost" refers to the local computer that a program is running on. It is a hostname that means "this computer" or "the computer running this program". When you access `localhost`, you are communicating with the local machine, which is the same device you are using.

### Key Points About Localhost:

1. **IP Address**: The IP address for localhost is typically `127.0.0.1` in IPv4 and `::1` in IPv6.

2. **Networking**: Using localhost bypasses the need for a network connection to communicate with the server, as it refers to the local system itself. This is useful for testing and development purposes.

3. **Development**: Developers often use localhost to run and test web servers, applications, or databases on their own computers before deploying them to a production environment.

4. **Security**: Connections to localhost are generally secure because they do not leave the local machine, reducing the risk of interception by external parties.

### localhost vs 127.0.0.1 Performance

This video argues against using localhost and instead recommends using the hard-coded IP address 127.0.0.1.

The speaker, Anthony,  says that using localhost can cause problems because it can refer to two different IP families, IPv4 and IPv6. Some programs try the V6 address first and then the V4 address, and others do the opposite. This can cause wasted time as the program tries the wrong address first. Additionally, looking up the name "localhost" usually involves an extra DNS lookup, even though it's on the same machine.

The speaker claims that switching from "localhost" to 127.0.0.1 can improve latency. He mentions that he made this change at his company and saw a 2% improvement in latency across all services.

> I added a benchmark test in my test script (Test 21) and I can confirm a better timing since we bypass **Name Resolution**.  
(Name Resolution: `localhost` is resolved via the `/etc/hosts` file or DNS. Typically, `localhost` is mapped to `127.0.0.1` in `/etc/hosts`)
