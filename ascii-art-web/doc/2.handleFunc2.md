## Handler Functions

**Signature**
```go
func somethingHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) 
```

`somethingHandler` is a convention often used to name `HTTP` handler functions.

**Parameters**

- `w http.ResponseWriter`:
    - *Purpose*: This is an interface that represents the connection to the client (web browser). It's the channel through which your Go server sends its response back to the user.
    - *Methods*: The `ResponseWriter` interface has methods for:
        -  Writing data to the response (e.g., `w.Write([]byte("Hello"))`)
        - Setting response headers (e.g., `w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html")`)
        -  Writing header and status code together (e.g., `w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)`)

- `r *http.Request`:
    - *Purpose*: This is a pointer to a Request struct. It contains all the information about the incoming HTTP request from the client.
    - *Information*: The Request struct holds:
        - HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.)
        - URL path and query parameters
        - Headers (user agent, cookies, etc.)
        - Body (if it's a POST request) 

### Example

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
)

func myHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/plain") // Set response content type
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)                 // Set status code 200 OK

    // Extract information from the request
    name := r.URL.Query().Get("name") // Get name from query parameter
    // http://localhost:8080/?name=Somthing

    // Construct the response
    if name == "" {
        name = "world" // Default to "world" if no name provided
    }
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello, %s!\n", name) 
}

func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/", myHandler)         // Register the handler for the root path
    http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil) // Start server on port 8080
}
```

1. `w http.ResponseWriter`

- **Interface**:  `ResponseWriter` is an interface, meaning it defines a set of methods that any type implementing it must provide. It serves as a contract between your handler function and the underlying HTTP server implementation.

- **Methods**: The key methods you'll use with `ResponseWriter` are:
    - `Header() http.Header`: Returns a map-like structure (`http.Header`) representing the response headers. Use this to set or modify headers before sending the response.
    - `Write([]byte) (int, error)`: Writes raw byte data to the response body.
    - `WriteHeader(statusCode int)`: Sets the HTTP status code of the response (e.g., `http.StatusOK`, `http.StatusNotFound`). This should typically be called before writing the body.

- **Purpose**: The `ResponseWriter` acts as your gateway for constructing and sending the HTTP response back to the client. You use its methods to:
    - Set the content type (e.g., `w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html")`).
    - Write the response body (e.g., `w.Write([]byte("Hello, world!"))`).
    - Optionally set cookies or other headers.

- **Implementation**: The actual implementation of `ResponseWriter` is hidden from you. The `net/http` package handles the details of translating your calls into the appropriate network communication. This abstraction allows you to focus on building the response content.

2. `r *http.Request`

- **Pointer to a Struct**: The `r` argument is a pointer `(*)` to a `Request` struct. This struct is a rich source of information about the incoming HTTP `request`.

- **Fields**: The `Request` struct contains fields for:
    - `Method`: The HTTP method used (GET, POST, etc.).
    - `URL`: The requested URL, including path, query parameters, and fragment.
    - `Header`: The request headers (user agent, cookies, etc.).
    - Body: The request body (if present, as in POST requests).
        ...and more!

- **Purpose**: You use the Request struct to examine the details of the request and make decisions based on that information. You might:
    - Check the URL path to determine what resource the user wants.
    - Read query parameters to get additional input.
    - Parse form data from POST requests.
    - Check headers for authentication or other purposes.
