## What is a Server?

- Servers are programs that supply data to a client in response to a request.

- Servers can be software programs or physical computers.

- When we say "server," we often refer to the **function** it performs - providing services or resources to other devices (clients) over a network. This role can be fulfilled by software or a dedicated physical machine. So, while we use the term "server" to describe a specific function, it's important to remember that it's not a magical entity. It's simply a combination of software running on hardware, working together to provide services over a network.

- **Server as software**: This is a program designed to listen for requests, process them, and send back appropriate responses. Web servers, email servers, and database servers are examples of software that play the role of a server. (But in the end it's just a software)

- **Server as hardware**: This is a computer (often with powerful specifications) built to run server software efficiently. It might have features like redundant power supplies or larger storage capacity to handle the demands of serving multiple clients. (But in the end it's just a computer)

## How servers work:

- Servers communicate with clients using **sockets**, which are mechanisms that programs can use to send and receive data over a network.
- When a client sends a request to a server, the server processes the request and sends a response back to the client.
- The request and response messages are formatted according to a specific **protocol**, such as HTTP, TCP/IP, UDP (User Datagram Protocol ), or (IPC) Inter-Process Communication (like Unix domain sockets (UDS)).

Web servers (Apache, Nginx), database servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL), mail servers, and game servers are all examples of servers.
