# REST

REST, or Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a stateless, client-server, cacheable communications protocol -- typically, the HTTP protocol. In RESTful systems, resources are identified by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators), and interactions with these resources are performed using standard HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.

## Key Concepts of REST:

1. **Stateless**: Each request from a client to server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request. The server does not store any context about the client session.

2. **Client-Server**: The client and server operate independently, allowing them to evolve separately. The client makes requests to the server, which processes them and returns appropriate responses.

3. **Cacheable**: Responses must define themselves as cacheable or not to prevent clients from reusing stale or inappropriate data in response to further requests.

4. **Uniform Interface**: REST uses standard HTTP methods and status codes, and these must be used consistently across the API for accessing resources.

5. **Layered System**: A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to the end server or to an intermediary along the way. Intermediary servers can improve system scalability by enabling load-balancing and by providing shared caches.

6. **Code on Demand (optional)**: Servers can extend the functionality of a client by transferring executable code (e.g., JavaScript).

## Common HTTP Methods:

- **GET**: Retrieve data from a specified resource.
- **POST**: Submit data to be processed to a specified resource.
- **PUT**: Update a specified resource with new data.
- **DELETE**: Remove a specified resource.
- **PATCH**: Apply partial modifications to a resource.

## Example of RESTful API Endpoints:

Suppose you have a resource called users. The following could be the endpoints:

- **GET /users** - Retrieves a list of users.
- **GET /users/{id}** - Retrieves a specific user by ID.
- **POST /users** - Creates a new user.
- **PUT /users/{id}** - Updates an existing user by ID.
- **DELETE /users/{id}** - Deletes a user by ID.

## Benefits of REST:

- **Scalability**: Due to statelessness and cacheable responses.
- **Performance**: By leveraging HTTP caching mechanisms.
- **Modularity**: Independent evolution of client and server.
- **Simplicity**: Use of HTTP and standardized methods for interaction.

# REST API

A REST API (short for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a way for different software systems to communicate with each other over the internet. It's a set of rules and conventions that make it easier for developers to build web services that are scalable, flexible, and easy to maintain.

Here's a simplified analogy:

Imagine a restaurant. You (the client) want to order food (data). You look at the menu (the API documentation) to see what's available and how to place an order. You then send your order to the waiter (the API endpoint), who relays it to the kitchen (the server). The kitchen prepares your food (processes the request) and sends it back to the waiter, who brings it to your table (the response).

## Key Features of REST APIs

- **Client-Server Architecture**: REST APIs are designed around a clear separation between the client (the application making requests) and the server (the application providing data and services).
- **Statelessness**: Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information necessary to understand and process that request. The server doesn't keep track of the client's state between requests.
- **Cacheability**: Responses from the server can be cached, which means that the client can store a copy of the response and reuse it for subsequent requests, improving performance.
- **Layered System**: REST APIs can be composed of multiple layers, each with its own specific role (e.g., security, load balancing, caching).
- **Code on Demand (Optional)**: REST APIs can also transfer executable code from the server to the client, although this feature is not always used.

## Why REST APIs Are Popular

- **Flexibility**: REST APIs can be used with various data formats (like JSON, XML) and communication protocols (like HTTP).
- **Scalability**: REST APIs can be easily scaled to handle large numbers of requests.
- **Language and Platform Independence**: REST APIs can be used with any programming language and platform that can make HTTP requests and process responses.
- **Standardization**: REST APIs follow well-established standards, making them easy to understand and use.

## How REST APIs Are Used

REST APIs are used in a wide range of applications, including:

- **Web Applications**: REST APIs are commonly used to provide data and services to web pages and mobile apps.
- **Microservices**: REST APIs are often used to connect different components of microservices architectures.
- **System Integration**: REST APIs can be used to integrate different software systems and platforms.
- **Cloud Services**: Many cloud providers offer REST APIs for their services.

## Real-World Examples:

- The World Wide Web itself is the most famous example of a RESTful system.
- Many social media platforms (like Twitter, Facebook) provide REST APIs for developers to interact with their services.
- Cloud providers (like AWS, Azure) expose their services through REST APIs.

# Architectural Style

An architectural style in software engineering defines a set of principles and guidelines for designing a system's architecture. It provides a framework for structuring software systems by specifying the components, their interactions, and the constraints on these interactions. Architectural styles help ensure that a system is scalable, maintainable, and robust.

## Key Characteristics of Architectural Styles:

1. **Components**: The fundamental building blocks of the system (e.g., modules, services, layers).
2. **Connectors**: The communication mechanisms between components (e.g., method calls, message passing, network protocols).
3. **Constraints**: The rules and guidelines that govern the interactions between components and connectors.
4. **Configurations**: The overall structure and organization of components and connectors in the system.

## Common Architectural Styles:

1. **Layered Architecture**:
    - Description: Divides the system into layers, each with specific responsibilities.
    - Example: OSI model, MVC (Model-View-Controller).
    - Use Case: Systems requiring separation of concerns and abstraction layers.

2. **Client-Server Architecture**:
    - Description: Separates the system into clients (requesters) and servers (providers).
    - Example: Web applications, email systems.
    - Use Case: Distributed systems requiring centralized resources or services.

3. **Microservices Architecture**:
    - Description: Composes the system of small, independent services that communicate over a network.
    - Example: Modern web applications like Netflix, Amazon.
    - Use Case: Large, scalable applications requiring independent deployment and development.

4. **Event-Driven Architecture**:
    - Description: Components communicate through the production and consumption of events.
    - Example: Real-time systems, IoT applications.
    - Use Case: Systems requiring real-time processing and asynchronous communication.

5. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**:
    - Description: Organizes the system as a collection of loosely coupled services.
    - Example: Enterprise applications with web services.
    - Use Case: Complex systems requiring reusable and interoperable services.

6. **REST (Representational State Transfer)**:
    - Description: An architectural style for designing networked applications using stateless communication and standard HTTP methods.
    - Example: Web APIs.
    - Use Case: Web services requiring simplicity, scalability, and performance.

7. **Pipe-and-Filter Architecture**:
    - Description: Structures the system as a series of processing elements (filters) connected by pipes.
    - Example: UNIX shell commands.
    - Use Case: Data processing systems requiring sequential or parallel processing stages.

# Differences Between 2 and 6

### 1. Abstraction Level:

- **Client-Server Architecture**: A high-level model that defines the overall interaction between clients and servers.

- **REST**: A more specific architectural style that applies the client-server model with additional constraints and principles (statelessness, uniform interface, resource-based interactions).

### 2. State Management:

- **Client-Server Architecture**: May or may not be stateless. Servers often maintain session state for clients.

- **REST**: Always stateless. Each request from a client must contain all the information needed by the server to fulfill that request.

### 3. Communication Style:

- **Client-Server Architecture**: Can use various protocols and communication styles (e.g., HTTP, WebSocket).

- **REST**: Primarily uses HTTP and focuses on standard methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to manipulate resources.

### 4. Principles:
- **Client-Server Architecture**: Broad principles focusing on separation of client and server responsibilities.

- **REST**: Specific principles, including stateless communication, a uniform interface, and resource-based interactions.


## Key Principles of REST revisited

1. **Client-Server**: There's a clear separation between the client (the application making requests) and the server (the application providing data and services). This separation allows for independent evolution of both components.

2. **Statelessness:** The server does not store any client context between requests. Each request from the client must contain all the information necessary for the server to understand and process it.

3. **Cacheability**: Responses from the server can be cached, improving performance and efficiency by reducing the need to repeat requests for the same data.

4. **Layered System**:  RESTful systems can be composed of multiple layers, each with a specific role, such as security, load balancing, or caching.

5. **Uniform Interface**: This is the core principle of REST, and it consists of four constraints:
    - **Identification of resources**: Individual pieces of data (resources) are identified by unique URLs.
    - **Manipulation of resources through representations**: Clients interact with resources through representations (like JSON or XML) sent by the server.
    - **Self-descriptive messages**: Each message includes enough information to describe how to process it.
    - **Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS)**: Clients navigate the application by following links provided in the responses, instead of hardcoding URLs.
