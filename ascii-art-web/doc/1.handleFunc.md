## `http.HandleFunc`

The primary purpose of `HandleFunc` is to act as a bridge between incoming HTTP requests (from users' browsers) and the specific Go functions designed to handle those requests. It registers a *handler function* that will be executed whenever a request matches a given pattern (URL path).

**Signature**

```go
func HandleFunc(pattern string, handler func(ResponseWriter, *Request))
```

- `pattern`: A string representing the URL path on your web server to which this handler function will respond.

    - Examples: `"/"` (root path), `"/about", "/api/v1/users"`
    - You can use placeholders (e.g.,` /articles/{id}`) to match dynamic segments in the URL.

- `handler`: The function that will be called to process the request and generate the response. This function must follow a specific signature:

```go
func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request)
```

**How It Works**

1. **Registration**: When your Go program starts its HTTP server, you call `HandleFunc` multiple times to associate different URL patterns with their corresponding handler functions.

2. **Request Arrival**: When a user's browser sends a request to your server, the server checks the request's URL path.

3. **Pattern Matching**: The server compares the request path to all the patterns registered with `HandleFunc`. If a match is found, the associated handler function is invoked.

4. **Handler Execution**: The handler function is passed two arguments:
    - `w http.ResponseWriter`: An interface for writing the response back to the client.
    - `r *http.Request`: A pointer to the Request struct, containing information about the request.

5. **Response Generation**: Inside the handler function, you'll typically:
    - Extract data from the request (path parameters, query parameters, request body, etc.).
    - Perform any necessary logic (database queries, calculations, etc.).
    - Construct the response content (HTML, JSON, etc.).
        Set headers (Content-Type, cookies, etc.).
        Write the response to the `ResponseWriter` (w).


### Example

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", homeHandler)
	http.HandleFunc("/contact", contactHandler)

	log.Println("Starting server on :8080")
	err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Server failed to start: %v", err)
	}
}

func homeHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Welcome to the homepage!")
}

func contactHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, "Contact us at support@example.com")
}
```

In this example, requests to `/` will be handled by `homeHandler`, and requests to `/contact` will be handled by `contactHandler`.

### Note

In Go's `http` package, when you use `http.HandleFunc("/", HomeHandler)`, it registers the `HomeHandler` function to handle all requests that match the pattern "`/`". In Go, the "`/`" pattern is a special case that matches all URLs, not just the root URL. This behavior is because "`/`" is the catch-all pattern for the `http.ServeMux`.
