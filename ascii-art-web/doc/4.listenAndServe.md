## `http.ListenAndServe`

Let's break down the `http.ListenAndServe` function and clarify those port numbers.

`err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)` Explained

1. `ListenAndServe`: *This function is the heart of your Go web server*. It does two crucial things:
    - **Listening**: It tells your server to start listening for incoming HTTP requests on the specified port.
    - **Serving**: When a request arrives, it accepts the connection and dispatches the request to the appropriate handler function (which you registered using `http.HandleFunc`). This process continues indefinitely until the server is stopped or encounters an error.

2. `":8080"`:
    - **Port Number**: This is the network port on which your server will listen. It's like the address where clients can send their HTTP requests.
    - **Colon Prefix**: The colon (`:`) is necessary to indicate that the following number is a port number.

3. `nil`:
    - **Handler**: This argument is the handler to use for requests that don't match any specific registered routes. Since you've registered your `myHandler` for the root path (`/`), using `nil` here is fine. If a request comes in for a path that's not `/`, the default behavior is to send a "404 Not Found" response.
    - **Custom Handler**: If you wanted custom behavior for unmatched requests, you could create a handler function and pass it here instead of `nil`.

4. `err := ...:`
        **Error Handling**: The `ListenAndServe` function returns an error value (err). It's crucial to check this error to see if the server failed to start due to issues like port conflicts or incorrect configuration. Typical error handling would look like this:

```go
if err != nil {
    log.Fatalf("Server failed to start: %v", err)
}
```
