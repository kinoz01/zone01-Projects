## HTTP Server

Imagine a restaurant. The HTTP server is like the head waiter:

1. **Listens and Waits**: It constantly listens for incoming "orders" (HTTP requests) from clients (web browsers, mobile apps, etc.).
2. **Processes Orders**: When a request arrives, the server understands what's being asked for (e.g., a specific web page, data from an API).
3. **Prepares the Response**: The server fetches the requested resource, generates the appropriate content (HTML, JSON, etc.), and adds headers that describe the response.
4. **Serves the Response**: It sends the prepared response back to the client that made the request.

**HTTP Request**

Sticking with the restaurant metaphor, the HTTP request is like the order slip filled out by the customer:

1. **Method (the "Verb")**: Specifies the action the client wants to perform. Common methods include:
    - **GET**: Fetch a resource (e.g., a web page).
    - **POST**: Submit data to the server (e.g., form data, new blog post).
    - **PUT/PATCH**: Update existing data on the server.
    - **DELETE**: Remove a resource from the server.
2. **URL (the "Address")**: This tells the server exactly what resource the client is interested in. For example:
    - `https://www.example.com/about`
    - `https://api.example.com/users`
3. **Headers (the "Special Instructions")**: Provide additional information about the request:
    - `User-Agent`: Identifies the client's browser/app.
    - `Accept`: Tells the server what types of content the client can handle (e.g., HTML, JSON).
    - `Authorization`: Includes credentials for secure access.
4. **Body (Optional "Order Details")**: Used mainly with POST/PUT requests to send data to the server.
