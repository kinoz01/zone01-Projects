### Example of a `Func` that returns a Pointer

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// Define a struct type named 'ptr'
type ptr struct {
	value int
}

// Define the example function that returns a pointer to 'ptr'
func example() *ptr {
	// Create an instance of 'ptr'
	instance := ptr{value: 42}

	// Return a pointer to the instance
	return &instance
}

func main() {
	// Call the example function and get the returned pointer
	result := example()

	// Print the value from the pointer
	fmt.Println("Value:", result.value)
}
```

`*ptr`: This indicates the return type of the function. The `*` symbol denotes a pointer, so the function returns a pointer to a type named `ptr`.

> In Go, when a function returns a pointer to a type, it returns the memory address where the value of that type is stored. This means that instead of returning a copy of the value, the function returns a reference to the value's location in memory.

> The key point is that the function returns a pointer, which is essentially a memory address. This allows the caller of the function to access and manipulate the original value stored at that memory address. It avoids copying the entire struct and is useful for passing large structures or when you need to modify the original data.
