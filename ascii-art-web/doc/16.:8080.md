When using:

```go
err := http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Server failed to start: %v", err)
	}
```

The web server listens on all available network interfaces by default. This is specified by using `":8080"` in the `http.ListenAndServe` function call. The colon (`:`) before the port number means that the server will bind to all available IP addresses on the machine.

To bind the server to a specific IP address (for example `localhost` (`127.0.0.1`)) you should use:

```go
http.ListenAndServe("127.0.0.1:8080", nil)
```

> Listening on all network interfaces means that the server will accept incoming connections on any IP address assigned to the machine. This includes all network interfaces configured on the machine, such as those for Ethernet, Wi-Fi, virtual interfaces, and more.

## Network Interfaces and Examples

Here are some common types of network interfaces that might be present on a typical computer:

1. **Loopback Interface (localhost)**:
    - **IP Address**: 127.0.0.1
    - **Description**: This is the internal network interface that the system uses to communicate with itself.
    - **Example Usage**: Running development servers accessible only on the local machine.

2. **Ethernet Interface**:
    - **IP Address**: Varies (e.g., 192.168.1.100, 10.0.0.1)
    - **Description**: This is the wired network interface used for connecting to a local area network (LAN) via an Ethernet cable.
    - **Example Usage**: Connecting to the internet or a corporate network.

3. **Wi-Fi Interface**:
    - **IP Address**: Varies (e.g., 192.168.1.101, 10.0.0.2)
    - **Description**: This is the wireless network interface used for connecting to Wi-Fi networks.
    - **Example Usage**: Accessing the internet wirelessly at home, in a coffee shop, or at work.

4. **Virtual Network Interfaces**:
    - **IP Address**: Varies (e.g., 192.168.56.1 for VirtualBox, 172.17.0.1 for Docker)
    - **Description**: These are software-defined interfaces used by virtualization software, such as VirtualBox, Docker, or VMware, to provide networking for virtual machines or containers.
    - **Example Usage**: Running virtual machines or containers that need network access.

5. Tethering Interfaces:
    - **IP Address**: Varies (e.g., 192.168.42.129)
    - **Description**: Used when sharing an internet connection from a mobile device to a computer.
    - **Example Usage**: Using a smartphone to provide internet access to a laptop.

#### Example Scenario

Assume your machine has the following network interfaces configured:

- Loopback: 127.0.0.1
- Ethernet: 192.168.1.100
- Wi-Fi: 192.168.1.101
- Docker: 172.17.0.1

If your Go server is configured to listen on all network interfaces by using `http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)`, it will be accessible via any of these IP addresses.

Accessing the Server:

- From the same machine (loopback): http://127.0.0.1:8080
- From another device on the same LAN (Ethernet or Wi-Fi): http://192.168.1.100:8080 or http://192.168.1.101:8080
- From a Docker container: http://172.17.0.1:8080

### Linux Commands

To get all the IP addresses assigned to your machine in Linux, you can use several different commands. Here are a few methods:

```bash
ip addr show
```

```bash
ip -o -4 addr list | awk '{print $4}'
ip -o -6 addr list | awk '{print $4}'
```

```bash
ifconfig
```

```bash
ifconfig | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}'
ifconfig | grep 'inet6 ' | awk '{print $2}'
```

```bash
hostname -I
```

```bash
nmcli device show > netinfo.txt
```

```bash
ip a
```

> **Routing Table**: The `route -n` command shows you how your system is configured to route traffic to different destinations, and which IP address might be used for each route.
