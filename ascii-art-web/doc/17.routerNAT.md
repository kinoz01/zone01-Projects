# Question 1
> Port 80 is conventionally reserved for HTTP traffic. Could you explain whether this applies to the client or server side? Additionally, could you provide a Linux command to check the IP address and port I'm connecting to when using a browser, as well as my own IP address and the port being used?

## Port 80 and HTTP

Port 80 is reserved for HTTP traffic and is primarily used by servers. When a client (such as a web browser) wants to access a web page, it sends an HTTP request to the server on port 80 (unless another port is specified).
Checking Connections in Linux

To check the port and IP addresses you are connecting to using a browser, and to find out your IP and port used in these connections, you can use the netstat, `ss`, or `lsof` commands.

### Using `ss`

`ss` is a powerful tool for displaying network socket information.

```bash
ss -tnp
```

### Using `netstat`

```bash
netstat -tnp
```

- `-t`: Show TCP sockets.
- `-n`: Show numerical addresses.
- `-p`: Show the process using the socket.

## Understanding IP and Port Assignment
### IP Address Assignment

- **IP Address** (`192.168.1.101`):
    - This is the local IP address of your device on the local area network (LAN).
    - It's typically assigned by your router using DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).
    - The `192.168.x.x` range is reserved for private networks, meaning these IP addresses are used internally within a network and are not directly reachable from the internet.

### Port Assignment

- **Port (55678)**:
    - This is an ephemeral (or dynamic) port assigned by your operating system.
    - When your computer makes an outgoing connection (e.g., to a web server), it uses a temporary port number in the range of 49152 to 65535. This range is defined by the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) as the default ephemeral port range.
    - The purpose of this port is to uniquely identify the connection from your machine to the remote server. This way, multiple applications or connections can coexist without interference.

## How IP and Port Are Assigned

1. **IP Address Assignment:**
    - When your device connects to a network, it typically sends a DHCP request to the router.
    - The router assigns an IP address from its available pool and leases it to the device. This assignment can be dynamic, changing periodically, or static if configured.

2. **Port Assignment for Outgoing Connections:**
    - When you initiate a connection to a server (e.g., typing a URL in your browser), your operating system automatically assigns an available ephemeral port.
    - This port is used for the duration of the connection and is released once the connection is closed.

## Example of IP and Port Assignment Process

1. DHCP IP Assignment:
    - Your device connects to the network.
    - It sends a DHCP Discover message.
    - The router responds with a DHCP Offer, providing an IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.101`).
    - Your device accepts this offer with a DHCP Request.
    - The router finalizes the lease with a DHCP Acknowledgment.

2. Ephemeral Port Assignment:
    - You open a browser and request `http://example.com`.
    - The operating system selects an available ephemeral port (e.g., `55678`).
    - The browser establishes a TCP connection from `192.168.1.101:55678` to the server's IP address on port `80`.
    - The TCP/IP stack in your operating system handles the routing and management of this connection.

# Question 3
> What about the public IP address I'm connecting with? Is it also private when it's assigned? How can a server send a response if the IP address is private?

When you connect to a server on the internet, several steps involving both your private IP address and your public IP address take place. Here's how it works:

## Private vs. Public IP Addresses

- **Private IP Address**: This is the address assigned to your device within your local network (e.g., `192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`). It is not routable on the internet.
- **Public IP Address**: This is the address assigned to your network by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). It is routable on the internet and is used for all devices in your local network to communicate with the outside world.

## Network Address Translation (NAT)

To understand how private and public IP addresses work together, we need to consider Network Address Translation (NAT):

1. **Device Initiates Connection:**
    - Your device, with a private IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.101`), initiates a connection to a server on the internet.

2. **NAT Translation:**
    - The request goes through your router, which has a public IP address assigned by your ISP.
    - The router uses NAT to map the outgoing request from your private IP address and port to its own public IP address and an ephemeral port. This creates a mapping in the router's NAT table.
    - For example, the connection might look like this internally: `192.168.1.101:55678 -> 93.184.216.34:80`, but to the external server, it appears as `203.0.113.5:12345 -> 93.184.216.34:80` (where `203.0.113.5` is the router's public IP and 12345 is the ephemeral port used by the router).

3. **Server Response:**
    - The server receives the request from your router's public IP address and responds to it.
    - The response is sent back to the public IP address and port used by your router.
    - The router receives the response, looks up the mapping in its NAT table, and forwards the response back to your device using the original private IP address and port.

## Commands to Check Public IP Address

To find out your public IP address from your local machine, you can use services like curl to query an external service:

```sh
curl ifconfig.me
```

or

```sh
curl icanhazip.com
```

# Question 4

> Explain more about NAT.

Network Address Translation (NAT) is a process used by routers to map multiple private IP addresses to a single public IP address (or a few) and vice versa. This is essential for devices within a local network to communicate with devices on the internet. Here's a more detailed explanation:
How NAT Works

1. **Initiating a Connection:**
    - A device inside your local network (e.g., your computer with IP `192.168.1.101`) wants to connect to a web server on the internet (e.g., example.com with IP `93.184.216.34`).

2. **Outgoing Request:**
    - Your computer sends a packet with its source IP address (`192.168.1.101`) and source port (e.g., `55678`) to the destination IP address (`93.184.216.34`) and destination port (`80` for HTTP).

3. **NAT Translation:**
    - When the packet reaches the router, the router performs NAT.
    - The router has a public IP address assigned by the ISP (e.g., `203.0.113.5`).
    - The router replaces the source IP address (`192.168.1.101`) and source port (`55678`) in the packet with its own public IP address (`203.0.113.5`) and an ephemeral port (e.g., `12345`).

4. **NAT Table Entry:**
    - The router creates an entry in its NAT table to remember this mapping. For example:

```ruby
192.168.1.101:55678 <--> 203.0.113.5:12345
```

- This entry allows the router to know where to forward the response from the web server back to the original device inside the network.

5. **Forwarding the Packet:**

- The packet is then forwarded to the destination (web server) with the new source IP and port.

6. **Receiving the Response:**

- The web server sends a response back to the routerâ€™s public IP address (`203.0.113.5`) and ephemeral port (`12345`).

7. **Reverse NAT Translation:**

- The router receives the response, looks up the NAT table, and finds the corresponding private IP address and port (`192.168.1.101:55678`).
- The router then replaces the destination IP address and port in the packet with the private IP address and port from the NAT table entry.

8. **Forwarding the Response:**

- The router forwards the packet to the original device (`192.168.1.101:55678`).

> When you use a command like curl icanhazip.com, you will basically receive the public IP address that your router uses to communicate with the internet. This is the IP address assigned to your router by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and it's the address seen by external websites and services when your devices within your local network make requests to the internet.
