## What is a Protocol?

- A protocol is a set of rules that defines how computer systems or programs should behave. It is a formal agreement between different parties on how to communicate with each other.

## HTTP 

An example of a protocol is HTTP, which is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol.

HTTP is the foundation of the World Wide Web. It's a communication protocol that defines how information is exchanged between web browsers (or application) (clients) and web servers. In simpler terms, it's the set of rules that allows your browser to fetch web pages, images, videos, and other resources from servers hosting websites.

### How does HTTP work?

1. **Request**: Your web browser sends a request to a web server. This request includes:
    - **Method**: The type of request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
    - **URL**: The address of the resource being requested.
    - **Headers**: Additional information about the request (e.g., browser type, accepted languages).
    - **Body (optional)**: Data sent along with the request (e.g., form data).

2. **Response**: The web server processes the request and sends back a response. This response includes:
    - **Status code**: A numerical code indicating the outcome of the request (200 OK, 404 Not Found, etc.).
    - **Headers**: Additional information about the response (e.g., content type, length).
    - **Body (optional)**: The actual data being requested (e.g., HTML code of a web page).

> Each request/response cycle is independent. Servers don't remember previous interactions.

### RFC Documentation

RFC 9110 and RFC 9112 are both documents that define aspects of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). They are part of a series of RFCs that were published in 2022 to update and clarify the HTTP standard.

[**RFC 9110: HTTP Semantics**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110)

This document describes the core concepts and terminology of HTTP. It covers the overall architecture of HTTP, the different types of messages that can be exchanged, and the meaning of various headers and status codes. RFC 9110 is essentially a high-level overview of how HTTP works. It establishes the foundation for understanding the other RFCs in the series.

[**RFC 9112: HTTP/1.1**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9112)

This document specifies the details of the HTTP/1.1 protocol. It covers the syntax of HTTP messages, the rules for establishing and maintaining connections, and the procedures for handling requests and responses. RFC 9112 is the technical reference for implementing HTTP/1.1 clients and servers.


## API

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules, **protocols**, and tools for building software applications. It defines how different software components should interact and exchange information with each other. In simpler terms, an API acts as a messenger that delivers your request to the provider that youâ€™re requesting it from and then delivers the response back to you.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Interface**: APIs provide a way for different software systems to communicate and share data, even if they are built using different technologies or languages.
- **Abstraction**: APIs hide the complex internal workings of a system and expose only the necessary functionalities to the users. This simplifies development and allows for easier integration.
- **Contracts**: APIs establish a clear contract or agreement on how the communication should happen. This includes the format of requests, the type of responses, and any error handling mechanisms.

### Common Types:

- **Web APIs**: These APIs are accessed over the internet using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). They are often used to provide data or services to web applications, mobile apps, or other systems. REST (Representational State Transfer) and SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) are common styles for designing web APIs.
- **Library/Framework APIs**: These APIs are provided by software libraries or frameworks to extend their functionalities or allow developers to customize their behavior. They are typically used within the same programming language.
- **Operating System APIs**: These APIs provide access to the underlying operating system's features, such as file operations, network communication, or hardware control.


### API and HTTP

While APIs often use HTTP as their underlying communication protocol, it's not entirely accurate to define an API as a protocol on top of HTTP.


- **Interface**: An API is better defined as an interface or a contract that specifies how software components should interact. It outlines the available functionalities, the data formats, and the rules for communication.
- **Abstraction Layer**: An API can be seen as an abstraction layer that hides the underlying implementation details of a system. Clients don't need to know how the server works internally, they just need to know how to use the API.

#### API and HTTP: A Common Partnership

- HTTP is often the foundation for web APIs due to its ubiquity and standardization. It provides a convenient way to structure requests and responses, making it easy for clients and servers to understand each other.
- REST (Representational State Transfer) is a popular architectural style for building APIs that leverages HTTP verbs and status codes to define a standard way of interacting with resources over the web.

## TCP

TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) is one of the main protocols of the Internet protocol suite, often referred to as TCP/IP. It is a connection-oriented protocol that operates at the transport layer of the internet protocol suite.

[RFC of TCP](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9293)

### Key characteristics of TCP:

- **Connection-oriented**: Before data transmission, TCP establishes a reliable connection between the sender and receiver. This connection ensures that data packets arrive in the correct order and without errors.
- **Reliable**: TCP provides mechanisms for error detection and correction, ensuring that all data is delivered reliably. If a packet is lost, TCP will retransmit it.
- **Ordered**: TCP guarantees that data packets are delivered in the same order they were sent.
- **Flow control**: TCP adjusts the rate of data transmission to prevent the receiver from being overwhelmed.
- **Congestion control**: TCP helps to prevent network congestion by reducing the rate of data transmission when the network is overloaded.

### How TCP works:

1. **Three-way handshake**: Before data transmission, TCP establishes a connection using a three-way handshake. This involves the sender sending a SYN packet, the receiver responding with a SYN-ACK packet, and the sender acknowledging with an ACK packet.
2. **Data transmission**: Once the connection is established, data can be transmitted in both directions. TCP breaks the data into smaller packets, each with a sequence number, and sends them over the network.
3. **Acknowledgement and retransmission**: The receiver acknowledges each packet it receives. If a packet is not acknowledged within a certain time, the sender will retransmit it.
4. **Flow control**: TCP uses a sliding window mechanism to control the flow of data. The sender can only send as much data as the receiver has space to buffer.
5. **Congestion control**: TCP uses a variety of algorithms to detect and respond to network congestion. This helps to prevent the network from becoming overloaded.
6. **Connection termination**: When the data transmission is complete, the connection is terminated using a four-way handshake.


### Use cases of TCP:

TCP is used for a wide range of applications that require reliable data transmission, such as:

- **Web browsing**: TCP is used to transfer web pages and other content between web browsers and web servers.
- **Email**: TCP is used to send and receive email messages.
- **File transfer**: TCP is used to transfer files between computers.
- **Remote login**: TCP is used to establish secure connections for remote login sessions.
- **Many other applications**: TCP is used by many other applications that require reliable data transmission.


### HTTP and TCP

To understand the relationship between HTTP and TCP, let's look at the layers of the network model:

1. **Application Layer**: This is where HTTP operates. It defines how web browsers and servers communicate, including the format of messages, the methods (GET, POST, etc.), and status codes.
2. **Transport Layer**: This is where TCP operates. It provides a reliable connection between the browser and server, ensuring that all data is delivered in the correct order and without errors.
3. **Network Layer**: This is where IP (Internet Protocol) operates. It handles the addressing and routing of data packets across the network.
4. **Link Layer**: This is where Ethernet and other physical network technologies operate. It deals with the actual transmission of data over the physical medium.

Here's how HTTP and TCP work together:

1. When you type a URL into your browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the web server.
2. This HTTP request is encapsulated in a TCP segment.
3. The TCP segment is then encapsulated in an IP packet.
4. The IP packet is sent over the network to the web server.
5. The web server receives the IP packet, extracts the TCP segment, and then extracts the HTTP request.
6. The web server processes the HTTP request and sends back an HTTP response.
7. The HTTP response is encapsulated in a TCP segment, which is then encapsulated in an IP packet, and sent back to the browser.
8. The browser receives the IP packet, extracts the TCP segment, and then extracts the HTTP response.
9. The browser renders the web page or other content based on the HTTP response.

#### Key points to remember:

- HTTP is an application layer protocol that defines how web browsers and servers communicate.
- TCP is a transport layer protocol that provides a reliable connection for HTTP messages.
- HTTP relies on TCP for reliable data transmission.
- TCP manages the connection between the browser and server, while HTTP handles the content of the communication.


#### Analogy

> HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is built on top of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol).

Imagine you want to send a letter (your HTTP request) to a friend in another city. You would:

1. Write your letter (craft the HTTP request).
2. Put it in an envelope with the correct address (encapsulate it in a TCP segment).
3. Drop it in a mailbox (send it over the network).

The postal service (TCP) ensures the letter reaches your friend's mailbox. Your friend opens the envelope (extracts the HTTP request) and reads your message. They then write a reply (the HTTP response), put it in an envelope, and send it back through the postal service.

In this analogy:

- The letter is the HTTP message.
- The envelope is the TCP segment.
- The postal service is TCP.


> **TCP** operates at the transport layer. It provides the reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data between applications running on different hosts. Think of it as the postal service that ensures your letters reach their destination.

> **HTTP** operates at the application layer, sitting above TCP. It defines the format and meaning of the messages exchanged between web browsers and servers. This is the language used to request and deliver web pages, images, videos, and other content.
