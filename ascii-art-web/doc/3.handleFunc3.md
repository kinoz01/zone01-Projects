## `http.HandleFunc` revisited

```go
http.HandleFunc("/", indexHandler) 
```

Components

- `http`: This is the Go standard library package for handling `HTTP` requests and responses. It provides all the tools you need to build web servers.
- `HandleFunc`: This is a function within the `http` package. It registers a handler function (in our case, `indexHandler`) to be called when a specific `HTTP` request pattern matches.
- `"/"`: This is the pattern that `HandleFunc` is looking for. It means "the root path of the website" (e.g., http://yourwebsite.com/).
- `indexHandler`: This is a function that you would define elsewhere in your code. It's responsible for generating the content (e.g., HTML, JSON, etc.) to send back to the client's web browser when they visit the `root` path of your website.

### How It Works

- **Server Setup**: You'd have some code that starts an `HTTP` server, listening for incoming connections on a specific port (like `port 80`).
- **Request Arrives**: When a user's web browser requests the root path of your site, the `HTTP` server receives this request.
- **Pattern Matching**: The server examines the request's path and compares it to the patterns registered with `HandleFunc`. In this case, the path `"/"` matches the pattern you registered.
- **Handler Execution**: The server calls the `indexHandler` function. This function typically does things like:
    - Access data (from a database, file, etc.)
    - Construct a response (HTML page, API data)
    - Set headers (content type, cookies)
    - Write the response back to the client
